istj_alt,ISTJ,"Pretty simple question: 

Are you active in sports? 

Or to be more precise, how often do you work out/do other sport-activities per week?

And of cause you can comment, what you do, looking forward to your answers!

This is a question I've been intrested in for a while, since all ISTJs I know are quist physically active and each have their sport they are passionate for (swimming for me, usually 3 times a week plus jogging and cycling around once a week)

istj_alt,ISTJ,"Hello people of reddit,

I am making this post to ask for your advice in a somewhat personal matter concerning an ENFJ friend of mine in general and the resulting dynamics of our friend group in general.  This is additionally also somewhat of a way to vent about this issue as i dont feel comfortable talking about there things with my frjends due to previous experiences (more on that later, really hope to remember it). For obvious privacy reasons (both about myself and people mentioned below) this is an alt account. If you feel like im talking about you, i am probably not as i am intentionally trying to keep it vague enough to not be traceable.

Firstly to sum up the situation: The ENFJ is a friend i know since school (currently at university) and we used to be great friends. This changed though over about the last year or so and we have (regrettebly) become more and more antagonistic towards each other. The issue mostly boils down to his way of interacting with the female members of our friend group. I dont know how best do describe it but he acts way different around them (two of them in particular) (he acts really cute and loving and allways tries to comfort the  even though it feels totally unwanted in most cases) and this makes it feel really ingenuine to the point where it makes me allmost sick watching him interact with them in that way. The main problem i see is the way he changes his behaviour and almost tries to keep others (especially me) away from them.

He exhibited this behavior before towards another girl who i am still friends with but who has allmost no connection to any other members of our core friend group, and in that case it was him having a crush on her and him not realising/accepting it for himself (she didnt feel the same way about him in it tok almost a year to accept and overome this). This time around he allready asked them out (and the other girls in our group too) and got a no.Of cause this does not mean he is in love, but he thought one of them had feelings for him as she showed sings towards both him and me (aperantly she does not have feelings for either of us but i have not talked to her directly as he was practically beggkng me jot to do it, either way all i wanted was clarity about the situation). Ever since then he has bin acting somewhat antagonistic towards me and has been trying to occupy their attention as much as possible when i am around.

This leads me to my interpretation of this whole mess. To mee it seems like he is not intentionally acting like this (although of cause some of it might be) and it might well be stress related (university and all the pressure that comes with it) and i do not really blame him for it (or at least i try not to). I tried as best i could to help him by talking to him and offering any help i mihht be able to provide but he allways shut me down until i decided to actually provoke him into talking to me and i used that opportunity to tell him how concrened i was and how i was just trying to help plus tell him to stop screwing with me (the thing is, every time we had a disagreement, i came out looking like an a-hole because he told everyone his view on things and how i was being mean while i do not really talk about personal issues leading to parts of our group thinking i was trying to manipulate him witn the goal of dating one of the hentioned girls (for the rexord, i do not have any such intention) with some of them only talking to me again after i basically had to force them to listen to my point of view (i do realise i might have been a bit reclesa in my handeling of the situation but i stil stand by my decision) and there is definitivly some lasting damage from the whole escapade), but it only made things worse as he basically told everyone my feelings got hurt and he, beeing such a nice guy, was trying to help me. I try not to blame him for what he did as he was and still is going through some stuff, although i do blame him for not accepting any help when he obviously needs it and is hurring others with his behaviour.

So tldr: I feel like my ENFJ friend is beeing dishonest and engaging in (self)destructive behaviour but does not see the need to accept or seek help with his issues.

Wich brings me to the reason  for posting this: I am mostly looking for advice on how to handle the situation and how ho help him
How do I get him to accept my help?
How do you think i can help best?
Should I try to show/tell the others how dishonest he is behaving?

Of cause any advice is wellcome and i am well aware that i am not perfect (not even close) and i might have dont things to mess things up too and if ao, please tell me, i am trying to impeove that part of me, social interations has never been my area of expertise.

Lastly I want to thank YOU for reading this huge text blob and for taking the time to listen to my problems. Even if you dont have anything to say about it, i still want to thank you for listening to me, you are a wonderful person, thanks!"

ayinayij,ISTJ,"What I did first is convert cubic feet to cubic meters by doing....

4.21 ft\^3 / 1 \* 1m/3.28ft \* 1m/3.28ft \* 1m/3.28ft  which gave me .1193m\^3

Then what I did was convert cubic meters to cubic decimeters by doing....

.1193m\^3 / (1 \* 10\^-1)  which gave me 1.193 dm\^3

After that, I figured the final step would be to convert dm\^3 to L, but by doing so, I end up with a final answer of 1.193 Liters, which is wrong. The correct answer should be 119 L

What am I missing?"

ayinayij,ISTJ,"So it seems like ever since I found MBTI, I‚Äôve seriously been carving myself out of these stereotypes. Especially since in my case, I got ENTJ, it‚Äôs been feeding my ego and pride to the max, and I‚Äôm seeing it in everyday life and interactions with other people. I find myself subconsciously acting like an ENTJ and trying to fit these stereotypes and live like an ENTJ. But I know that‚Äôs not healthy at all. I understand MBTI can be used to help you understand yourself and how you make choices, but I think I‚Äôm addicted. I check these MBTI subreddits and MBTI Instagram pages everyday, and I‚Äôm always looking for memes and posts I can relate to. It‚Äôs honestly super unhealthy, and at this point, I‚Äôm feeding my personality, ego, and pride. Especially bc ENTJs stereotypes are stuff like, ‚Äúconfident, natural leader, direct, assertive,‚Äù I find myself trying to live up to those standards. But i think it‚Äôs been a factor lately into my deteriorating mental health, ever since I discovered MBTI in Dec 2020. With that being said, I don‚Äôt know how long I‚Äôll step away from all this, but I need to live an independent life, free of MBTI influence for a while. Can anyone relate to this or feel like this too?"

leonoretta,ISTJ,"I feel like making this thread after repeatedly seeing comments about certain girls ""not doing much"" or ""just looking pretty"". One of the problems with Legendary is that it wants to be a dance show and have everyone do dance routines every episode when so many people in ballroom don't dance and don't have to, and the majority of the categories have nothing to do with dancing. It makes people think someone like Shannon Balenciaga or Eyrika Lanvin is a liability with quotes (to other girls) like ""you're a mother who doesn't just stand around and look pretty, you dance too!""

And at the same they cast these legendary and iconic face girls and end up making them look stupid evaluating them for voguing against the performance girls, and the result is viewers diminishing them when they have mastered their *own* category for decades in some cases, way before anyone even thought of a TV show about ballroom existing. Before some of those viewers were even born. Don't be that person. Aesthetic categories have been around for way longer than vogue and to this day they're way too important in the community for those women to be downplayed like that."
leonoretta,ISTJ,"Hey everyone. Growing up, did you consistently feel the way you do today regarding your typing / main functions? At what age do you think your personality ""solidified"" as ISTJ?

For me personally, I didn't know of MBTI back then, but now looking back at my teenage years I guess I seemed like more of an INFP. Cultivated a rich internal emotional world, was very concerned with beauty (in a broad sense, the beauty of things rather than physical appearence), played with Ne by writing dozens of pages in a mix of stream of consciousness and poetry (?) during school hours and had very little concern about studying or paying any attention to teachers. If I were to go back to school nowsdays I'd surely have better grades, cause I feel Si and especially Te stronger now than they were back then. I guess it could be just part of our development to explore these lower functions (Fi and Ne), since we do have them still, but did you guys also go through that?"

shtupty,ISTJ,"Ok, so I‚Äôm pretty sure I‚Äôm either a lesbian or a bisexual with a very strong female/non binary preference, but I‚Äôve been having dreams about being with fictional/celebrity men. I had them about Joe Keery, Jacob Artist, and Sam from Glee? I don‚Äôt feel attracted to men in any other area of my life but for some reason I was attracted to them in the dreams. Could it be my brain trying to subconsciously tell me I do like men? Because I haven‚Äôt had actual dreams about being with a woman in a non-sexual context. In the dreams they were idealized versions of men and unattainable in real life, but being in a relationship with them in my dream was kind of appealing? I really can‚Äôt imagine enjoying being with a man in real life but the dreams were very nice, so I‚Äôm confused!! If anyone could help me a bit, that‚Äôd be great!!!"

shtupty,ISTJ,"this subreddit seems kinda dead but i really want to know everyone‚Äôs opinions on elle. i personally really liked her character and i think that she had a lot of depth and honestly related to her a bit. i think that if it weren‚Äôt cancelled, in the second season she would do something to help allie and will bc of the scene of her saying she promised allie would get what she deserved, it seemed like there was something underlying"
coolbuckethat,ISTJ,"I frequently throw up my middle finger when meaning to hold up a peace sign by accident out of habit of flipping people off. Definitely not an ISTJ speciality, but if you do relate, just know I think you‚Äôre pretty cool.

Vunar,ISTJ,"Have you had  real people or fictional characters that you looked up to when you were young? For example your parents, superheroes, celebrities, sport's players (go sports!) etc and did your role models changed over the years? Have you ever thought to yourself ""I want to be like them so I will have what they have""? Did you want to have their fame, looks, money, abilities or anything else?

&#x200B;

Personally I'm from a broken home so looking up to my parents wasn't the best idea and two of my brothers didn't really inspire me. It wasn't until my early 20's when I've started to read books and consequently started to look up to people who know a lot, had ""great things to say"" or were ""people of the intellect""."
obelixthegaul,INTP,"Hello ISTPs. I (33M) have an ISTP (24F) neighbour who I am developing feelings for. 

We've lived next to each other for a couple of years and spoken here and there (usually to co-ordinate weed), but the last couple of months we've been hanging out more often. We eat pizza and watch movies or listen to music and chat about stuff until early hours of the morning.

We have also started sharing things about our lives with each other; eg, she had some annoying drama with some friends that I gave her advice on, she tells me about mental health struggles she has, and she consoled me when my dad died recently.

She came out of a long term relationship a few months ago and is still single, stays home 7 days a week except for work and as far as I know, no other dudes are hanging out with her.

With the data out of the way: problem is, we are both IxTPs and I have no idea whether this is just casual and friendly for her, or she might be developing feelings too. Probably, she has no idea about mine either, because I don't flirt either, even though I have to suppress imagining all the things I would do to her if I got the chance whenever we're together.

It's not as simple as ""just ask"" because we're neighbours, and I do value her friendship so I don't want to jump the gun or break things.

My questions for you are: a) does the fact that she wants to chill frequently, and opens up about the inside of her head, increase the odds that the feelings are mutual or does it indicate nothing?

And b) if a friend expresses feelings that you don't reciprocate how likely are you to pull back from the friendship?"

She's such a sweetie and is the only non-family to remember or say anything. It doesn't bother me that others don't, but it's very sweet that she does."

RegyptianStrut,ISTJ,"I too often see ""LGBT music"" described as ""a straight female diva singing about a heterosexual relationship"" when there's plenty of actual LGBT music by LGBT people about LGBT things.

Now, this is probably no surprise for modern music as homosexuality is generally accepted in the Western world, but there's plenty of pre-2000s songs that fit this category too. Don't believe me, well here's 20:

&#x200B;

1928: Ma Rainey - ""Prove It on Me Blues"" (Ma Rainey was WLM (not sure if she's gay or bi) and wrote this blues song about a woman with a woman.)

1968: Laura Nyro - ""Emmie"" (Bisexual singer/songwriter sings about being in love with a woman named Emmie)

1969: The Velvet Underground - ""Candy Says"" (written by Lou Reed, a bisexual man, this is a mellow song about his trans friend Candy Darling's gender dysphoria.) (Also notable is ""Sister Ray"")

**1972: Lou Reed (solo) - ""Walk on the Wild Side""  (this time it's about 3 transwomen, a bisexual man, and a gay man and their experiences in NYC)**

1973: Lavender Country - ""Back in the Closet Again"" (a gay country musician sings about his frustrations about the slow progression of gay rights) (also notable is ""Cryin' These Cocksucking Tears"" from the same album)

1973: Jobriath - ""I""m a Man"" (a gay glam rock song about his love for a man whom he'd love ""like a man loves a woman"")

**1974: David Bowie - ""Rebel Rebel"" (Bisexual singer, a glam rock song about Bowie's uncertainty with his sexuality and the gender fluidity that exists) (Also notable are ""Queen Bitch"", ""The Width of a Circle"" and ""Boys Keep Swinging"")**

1974: Peter Grudzien - ""There's A Star Spangled Banner Waving Somewhere"" (he's gay and he replaced the lyrics of this popular country song with queer ones.)

1977: Carl Bean - ""I Was Born This Way"" (a gay artist sings a disco song about how he was born gay and how he's happy with that)

**1978: The Village People - ""YMCA"" (By a group of all gay men, this is a subtle disco social commentary about how a lot of LGBT men would get kicked out of their houses and how the YMCA would often be their place of refuge) (Also notable is ""Go West"" about the gay pilgrimage to San Franciso, there's plenty of others like ""Macho Man"" ""I'm a Cruiser"" and too many to mention)**

**1978: Tom Robinson Band - ""Glad to Be Gay"" (He's bisexual and this is a punk anthem about gay pride, why isn't this song played at more pride parades?????)**

1981: Elton John - ""Elton's Song"" (Elton's gay and this song is about him growing up as gay.) (Also notable is ""All the Girls Love Alice"" about a straight female prostitute who sleeps with women for money)

1982: Joe Jackson - ""Real Men"" (Jackson is bisexual and this song vocalizes its support for gay rights while tearing down toxic masculinity)

1984: Divine - ""You Think You're a Man"" (This famous gay Drag Queen's song is mostly comedic, but it still depicts the love of the drag queen with a man as normal.)

1992: Faith No More - ""Be Aggressive"" (gay keyboard player Roddy Bottum convinced the lead singer to sing this alt. metal song about a guy sucking dick)

**1993: Melissa Etheridge - ""Come to My Window"" (lesbian singer singing about her girlfriend.)**

1993: Pansy Divison - The entire album...their entire career (an all gay pop-punk band)

1996: Meshell Ndegeocello - ""Leviticus: Faggot"" (A bisexual singer's neo-soul song about how poorly the religious treat gay people)

1997: Sleater-Kinny - ""One More Hour"" (Two bisexual women in the band sing a punky indie song about their breakup with one another)

1999: of Montreal - ""When a Man Is in Love with a Man"" (Kevin Barnes is bisexual and genderqueer, and this song is about how Kevin thinks it's special when two men are in love)

&#x200B;

This list is by no means exhaustive. I bolded the songs that were a hit.  I hope you can appreciate the song of these pre-Millenium LGBT themed songs by LGBT artists.

&#x200B;

\-----------------

&#x200B;

Suggestions by commenters that fit the theme:

1971: Labi Siffre - ""Bless the Telephone"" (a gay pop singer singing to someone he misses while on the telephone, this one's a bit vague in terms of being LGBT-themed directly, but the artist is gay and singing about love, so I'll include it)

1977: Judas Priest - ""Raw Deal"" (Rob Halford is gay, and although he didn't come out until the late 90s, he coded plenty of his songs with gay references, this one's no exception)

1978: Sylvester - ""You Make Me Feel (Mighty Real)"" (gay artist who sings about his love with a man on the dancefloor/the lyrics are a bit vaguely worded, but I'll count it anyway, especially since he does drag for the video)

1980: Pete Townshend - ""Rough Boys"" (Townshend is bisexual and this is about him wanting to sleep with the rough male punks of the era)

1981: Pete Shelley - ""Homosapien"" (This Buzzcocks lead vocalist is bi and this is his try at a gay pride anthem)

1984: Bronksi Beat - ""Smalltown Boy"" (gay artist who sings about the closeted youth of Scotland)

1987: Erasure - ""Hideaway"" (Andy Bell is gay and he sings about families who reject their children after coming out on this one)

1990: Pet Shop Boys - ""Being Boring (Neil Tennant is gay and this song makes a subtle reference to coming out of the closer)  (They also covered The Village People's ""Go West"")

1992: Coil - ""Theme from Gay Man's Guide to Safer Sex"" (Coil are a gay couple and they made the soundtrack to a MLM-positive sex instructional documentary) (Also notable LGBT tracks are their songs ""Love's Secret Domain"", ""The Anal Staircase"" and ""Slur"")

1993: Meryn Cadell - ""Jonny and Betty"" (Meryn is a transwoman and this song is about a young heterosexual couple who grow up to realize they're both gay)

1994: Green Day - ""Coming Clean"" (Bille Joe Armstrong sings about coming out as bisexual)

1995: Jill Sobule - ""I Kissed a Girl"" (Jill's bisexual and this song is about her kissing a girl)

1998: Rufus Wainright - ""Danny Boy"" (Rufus is gay and a man named Danny broke his heart)"

RegyptianStrut,ISTJ,"It's no secret that the Framer is the worst member of the mafia. In games with no Sheriff or Investigator, the Framer is beyond useless. My solution: why not make him affect Spy and Lookout too?

FOR SPY: If a framer framed a visiting role, the Spy will see THAT role as a mafia visit. For instance: the framer frames the Doctor, and the Doctor visits Jailor. The Spy sees that mafia visited Jailor when it was really the Doctor.

FOR LOOKOUT: It erases a visit. For instance: the framer frames a Doctor, the Doctor goes on Jailor, but the Lookout can't see that doctor visited the Jailor even if he watches the Jailor. This won't affect other visits. So if a Doctor and a Bodyguard both visit the Jailor and the Framer frames the Doctor, the Lookout will still see that the Bodyguard visited.

What do you guys think?"
RegyptianStrut,ISTJ,"I've had him since he was 7 months, and he's now 10 months old. Whenever he wants attention, he paws at me. While this looks cute, even when his nails are short, it hurts (and he'll anxiously scratch harder if you don't immediately give in.) And often even if I play with him for a minute after the pawing, the second I stop playing, he'll go right back to pawing me. Is there a better way to teach him how to ask for attention?

He knows how to sit and will sometimes sit for attention, which is great, but he won't use that method nearly as much as pawing at me. I've tried using the word ""no"" (a word I've taught him that usually works for stopping most unwanted behavior) and even firmly squeezing his paw (not too hard of course!) as a way to tell him I don't like this, but it only seems to work temporarily.

My last dog (of 13 years) never did this, even as a puppy, so I'm surprised at how much my new one is obsessed with this. He does suffer from anxiety and abandonment issues (from previous owners,) so I assume his reliance on pawing is related. What's the best method to train this out of him?"

Now comes the important part:

* I have never played Apex. I am not into PvP but that's a different story. Point is someone got access to the account.
* My last logged in Origin (to add Apex but never completed the download) was in 2019 right after Apex launched.
* The password was never saved in any of my browser. Heck I forgot the old password. But can't rule out it was a reused password. 2FA was off.
* I only have 2 games in Origin (sims demo & Apex).
* A dormant account with ZERO activity/games got hacked.
* The cheater logged in to my account yesterday (I am assuming whoever it is logged in yesterday for the first time). Played for hardly a few minutes and got banned.

For now I'll just ask support to thrash my account. All my important account passes have already been changed. But I really had this feeling regarding the time. EA said during the recent hack no user info was leaked. I wonder if any other player experienced similar hack or hacking attempt in their account, specially in last 24hrs or so."
kaushiksam,ISTJ,"Seen too many post.. ok lets be honest this sub has been like this, since ever. Introverts blaming themselves for being introvert. The ""other type"" blaming introverts for being introvert. The world blaming introverts for being introvert.

Post like family/friend/coworker not liking someone cause they don't speak much. Family members failing to understand introvert and mixing it with mental issues. Introverts blaming themselves again, forgetting they blamed themselves already in above sentence.

I used to blame myself for the words I said. For the words I failed to say. For people getting offended cause they fail to understand the deeper meaning of what I said. People getting offended cause they broke up with their gf. Nah the last part is a joke. And no I didn't steal his gf. Ok the moral of the rant is, people will blame you. They'll find problems with you even. And they won't like you.

How do you escape this hell? I follow a simple rule: If something makes you happy without causing others harm, it is the right thing. Some people will have problem with this simple rule too. And if someone has better rule, feel free to share it. Promise I won't steal it.

Remember there are 7.9B people (and counting) in this world. If you really want to keep everyone happy... Good luck I guess. As for me, I hope this rant of mine didn't cause any harm to anyone."

kaushiksam,ISTJ,"**Prologue:** 3 days after the game was released, me and my 2 friends brought and played till we beaten the Elder and started exploring Swamp. Lately progress has been slow as I have to maintain my solo world and everyone else is busy in real life. Last week the group came together to offer Bonemass a proper thrashing. One of my friends since left but hopefully he‚Äôll be back when we take on Moder.

&#x200B;

[My friend has a history of using too much brain as he constructed a fence to limit Bonemass movement.](https://preview.redd.it/y3obpcl9lgv61.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=e9f44283b938ea748604b313ed539bdb774cf1da)

**Present:** After defeating Bonemass, the next obvious choice was to explore the mountains and then go after Moder. Problem was, out of 3 hills scaled, only 1 had silver. That also a single silver vein. It was barely enough to make 2 Dragur Fangs and just a Wolf coat for each of us, 2 players. So starts an epic journey to find Silver and hopefully Moder in the same go.

We started our journey packing only the bare essentials. 150 wood for structure and a single portal worth of material in our longboat. No iron/copper as Silver smelting was to be done at base.

**Note:** Till date we have explored only the central 2-3% of the world and our longest journey so far was to reach Bonemass spawn which took almost 2 days.

From the start I knew, this voyage will span days. My plan was to find the tallest mountain in the South and scale it. The only condition being the mountain must have connection with Black Forest/Meadows, so we get a safe passage. After sailing for ‚Äòdays‚Äô, we found several tall mountains capable of holding Moder spawn but every single one had plains. Getting frustrated, we made a pitstop in a tiny black forest island and constructed a portal room.

Next day I (solo) went looking for a suitable mountain but to my shock, 90% of the world was Plains with occasional Swamp. I went past Mistland and almost reached Ashlands yet no Mountain with Black Forest. Out of option, decided to scale the nearby Mountain. It was surrounded by Plains on all side but it was a risk I was ready to take. After surveying the area, found a narrow plains shore and we docked our boat and began the climb. Luckily not a single squito/fuling spawned and we reached the top in no time.

Immediately at the top we found a Dragon Egg and prayed for Moder‚Äôs spawn. As we started exploring, the first day saw us getting attacked by 2 Stone Golem, numerous Wolf and uncountable number of Drakes but also managed to locate 3 Silver veins apart from another Dragon Egg. But as luck had it, no Moder spawn. The next day we dug out the 3 veins while fending off even more attack from Stone Golem. My friend frustrated with the Stone Golem, dragged one into the empty Silver pit using the Harpoon I gifted him earlier.

&#x200B;

[Someone is having too much fun with the Harpoon](https://preview.redd.it/5oxn1ydulgv61.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=b6c2dd8c71b4eb9f82dadc139d8fe1dbe885aaa8)

This triggered a kind of rush in him and he started Harpooning anything that bothered him. Nothing was safe in this mountain and everything got ‚ÄòHarpooned‚Äô. Wolf, Stone Golem, even Drake. He even tried to harpoon a Fening but ran out of stamina. That night he asked me if it is possible to Harpoon a Deathsquito. I was like ‚ÄòWait, you want to harpoon a what?‚Äô.

Day 3 started with me alone as I mapped the entire mountain, realizing the actual mountain was way too small. It was high but the actual area was way too small for any kind of spawn. Luckily, I discovered even more silver, 4 more veins. And as soon as my friend joined, dug out the rest. Now we had a MASSIVE 574 pieces of silver in total. My calculations showed the Longboat storage will be full and we can carry the remaining few pieces in our backpack. What I didn‚Äôt calculate was the 2 Dragon Egg that we were planning to ship back to base. Those were purely for decorative purpose but we really wanted those. This means we need to take 2 trips to the mountain base. Once for silver and another time for Eggs.

As we were about to leave the base, I noticed something is off. Our boat was docked on the opposite side of the mountain. Which means we need to push our cart up and over the mountain, which is not possible. There was another way though: Though a large path of plains and into the coast. It was a suicide mission.

But getting smashed in the head repeatedly by tree & golem has messed up our brain and the ability to think correctly, and we decided pulling a cart though a kilometer long plains is a better way. Better way my ass. As you‚Äôll hear shortly.

&#x200B;

[No No No. This is a huge misunderstanding. It wasn't me who harpooned you.](https://preview.redd.it/bayjjelxjqv61.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=be82dbb386c433fc8735a8e75615810cddab6b1e)

The journey downhill started relatively safe. Killed a deathsquito with bow but as soon as we reach the midpoint of plains, the cart physics went upside down and it started getting stuck every few feet. Digging & flattening the earth did absolutely nothing. As a desperate last measure, I ended up hoarding some 6000kg of silver. As we almost reached the shore, the sun went down and with it came a torch wielding Fuling Fuck Party. By the time I managed to unload the silver, only a tombstone remained in my place. Same for my friend who drank poison resistance mead instead of healing. Brain hemorrhage 101 right there.

The corpse run was scheduled for next morning and it went far smother as no squito was at sight and the fuling party from last night was gone. We carried out another run for the remaining Silver & Dragon Egg, using me as a human cart. Someone in my group really loves the harpoon.

Next, we had to reach the longboat which was parked at a good distance. We decided to go through the plains as a shortcut. We got attacked by a few squito and fuling but managed to take care of them easily. When we reached the longboat, we felt a sigh of relief to find it in one piece. It got a few dents here and there but was in one piece in Fuling land. But just as we were about to leave, a couple of fuling spawned. Luckily a tiny patch of Black Forest nearby spawned a few greydwarves which gladly agreed to lay down their own lives so we can escape with our boat.

Reaching the dock, we started onloading the silver only to get attacked by blobs & dragur from swamp next door. We made easy work of them but this costed time. Time we seriously didn‚Äôt have. The longboat was jampacked with silver and only a single stack of silver, a few pieces of black metal and 2 giant Dragon Eggs remained when last night fuling party returned. Extremely luckily, the boat was not beached and we managed to made a daring escape with the boat at 50% HP.

&#x200B;

[You can never have too much silver](https://preview.redd.it/yuuxfon2mgv61.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=fadc5ced736cf8a5fe0321a55ecb1588eb737dfc)

That night we had a sound sleep as despite death; we have successfully transported an entire mountain worth of silver though Plains dressed in Troll armour with only the upper body being protected by lv1 Wolf armour. Next day we took our boat back and packed a cart on top with the remaining stuff.

The return journey took only a single day as we followed the same trail back home. We did attract 2 serpents on our way back but decided not to fight as the cargo on board was way more precious than serpent meat and being greedy can severely backfire.

&#x200B;

[Our minimalist dock](https://preview.redd.it/q7cljkommgv61.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=f323bfd656cfd53d45e43c3cce25a9b7f40ed78b)

We reached home early morning having sailed overnight and as soon as we docked, got greeted by a cold wind. This time again I was caught with my pants down (aka too much silver in my backpack). Unable to move and lacking frost mead, died in an embarrassing way. As the Drakes left, we promised to ourselves Moder will pay for the deaths as I got harpooned again. Only this time the weight counter showed 7884kg.

&#x200B;

[Makes me wonder how am I still standing with almost 8000kg of stuff](https://preview.redd.it/pj4cy15pmgv61.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=bf42a9df21413a08f08b5b9d23551f6725f9adbc)

On reaching the base my friend commented that this was the single best adventure in Valheim he has ever undertaken. ‚ÄúNo idea where we are going. No idea if we‚Äôll even return. No idea on what we‚Äôll discover and on who‚Äôs hands/spikes we‚Äôll end up dying. But this adventure is one of the best thing I have ever undertaken.‚Äù I assured him that this is just the beginning and more wild stuff are to follow as we‚Äôll soon venture again to find Moder and then conquer the Plains (or get one shotted by a 2\* spear holding a-hole).

pdelight,ENTP,"i.e giving snarky/negative/sarcastiv comments, dismissing your behaviour & opinions, asking to tone it down and so on.

and to be clear, these can come from people who otherwise love you and are close to you, so not just school bullies or st.

just wondering if there‚Äôs a pattern here."
pdelight,ENTP,"i have a habit of blurting out my findings to close people before making 100% sure they're 100% practical & usable. like if it makes sense enough with thee or more examples and i see enough people share their experiences about it, i will share whatever finding to friends and will probably later find out it wasn't actually that usable and thus will also share that as quickly as i did the false one. this whole ordeal comes off badly to my more reserved & steady-thinking fam (mostly consists of IJs & IPs), so i feel insecure about it from time to time. sometimes that stops me from talking to them altogether but like... not for long enough until i just have to let it out, haha.

this is no problem with interests that are fully practical and scientific like learning canine behaviour or best ways to make money or what kinds of clothes literally physically work best in certain bodies (just to state some of the stuff i've been interested in). but with my other more abstract-esq interests such as MBTI (or anything psychology related tbh), i find that there's a clear pattern to share and also clear jumble of variables to kick those patterns out the window at the same time. and sharing that is a pain in the social sense... me myself am very excited every time i come up with something new, no matter what i find - altough, i definitely feel incapable and stupid most times i'm proven wrong after being super sure -, but this hastiness of information flow, if you will, makes people closest to me be very hesitant to either trust the system/thing i'm studying or they have thought that i'm being a bit crazy or caring too much about unimportant things. and that bugs me a lot. they're the only people i share these things with anyways, so being met with negative body language & reactions is not great, even though in any other situations our relationships are great & supportive.

so... what to do?"
pdelight,ENTP,"i live in northern europe but we have many if not most of the UK brands on sale here, so i thought i could ask this here.

after some research it appears that my hair is probably high porosity and low on proteins, so i'm trying to look for a product to help with that. my hairtype is very thin, stringy & fine but gets fluffy easily due to the frizz (especially if i brush it). i haven't started the CGM properly yet, but i'm in the process of doing it the next wash day.

what would you suggest?"
pdelight,ENTP,"Hi, first post here. :) I've often wondered if I belong to the petite section or not, but for the most of my life we haven't had petite brands in our country and, while I've always loved fashion, I never really knew how to dress for my body type either way. So with also all of my friends being either significantly shorter or taller than me, I didn't really know where to stand or how to even think about it. Many say I look moderate when I wear normal clothes (i.e a tee + straight pants), but in more body shape-showing things like bikinis it's clear that my overall height is short - especially due to my limbs.

If one is to look at my torso only, I look very ""normal sized"" for height, but my limbs are somewhat shorter in proportion (I'm also naturally curvy too so it enhances the shortness) and usually the clothing fit problems come with sleeves & legs being always too long and/or straight for me. So, as someone who's slowly finding more fashionable things interesting and something to wear in my actual life instead of just dreaming, what should I look for when shopping for these proportions? Is there any special types of garments that would fit well?

*FYI, I did the measurements mentioned* [*here*](https://www.jeetly.com/style-advice_am-i-petite_33)*, and got these: Shoulder width: aprox. 39cm, Neck to Waist: 36-37cm, Shoulder to wrist: aprox. 53cm (I did take these myself so they might vary from reality by one or two centimetres)*

Do you share a similar situation? What would you suggest? Any help would be appreciated. :)"
RaxtusDragonMCPE,ISTJ,"So apparently I have been friends with an INFJ for over 5 months I just recalled my past memories comparing my first time meeting him vs Now (we have an estsblished friendship and already got to know him more)

First time meeting him: At first I see him as a chill person who is also good at having deep conversations.

Now (Present): I get to see more of his funny side of him such as posting weird memes in general (discord). Going in filthy frank level of craziness, and chaotic in a joking and meme manner. I sometimes asked myself on what the heck just happened

So yeah I was wondering if there are any similar experiences like mine xddd. Don't worry I'm still friends with him I just got surprised on a sudden burst of chaos xdd ;-;"
RaxtusDragonMCPE,ISTJ,"I am an admin and a leader of the staff team of a discord servers consist of almost 10k members. The staff team consists of ISFJs, ISFPs and an ENFP. The main weakness that the team has is the lack of someone taking charges and making a decision because I'm always that person who makes decision and telling everyone what to do however I just realized I need someone who is good at keeping everyone together and don't mind making decisions and stick with it.

Most people considered me as a strict boss on how I took my job seriously even thought its just a discord server that I'm willing to use that experience in a job (for the future).

The story starts when the staff team told me to mod this person named ""Derp"" (His discord username) who is an INFJ because derp is good at dealing with people and understanding their emotions based on what people feel and also he's a good friend so I been thinking about this before I gave him mod for a temporarily amount of time to see how it goes.

I followed on what everyone wants is to mod Derp (INFJ). I know there will be some bias because derp ia a friend of ours and people might call me out for biased normally we hire people through the mod applications however for derp's case it was out of everyone's request. So after I give him mod I watch him carefully throughout in 1 week to see how it goes. It turns out to be EXTREMELY GOOD this is the exact type of person that I am desperately looking for. Someone who is good at dealing people based on emotions, making decisions and executing plans someone I can trust when comes to have another person who can lead. 


At the end I accept him as a part of the staff team as times goes on I even promote him to senior mod due to how good he was on his job. As an ISTJ my main struggle of being a leader of the staff team is trusting people but Derp's case I give myself a try and see how it goes its all worth it :)


That's the end of my personal story you INFJs are amazing with people and knowing how to understand them without slaming that logic and rational thinking that much."
RaxtusDragonMCPE,ISTJ,I just finished watching the anime in netflix so I ended up searching for the manga to read so I was wondering on what chapter of the manga do I start reading?
RaxtusDragonMCPE,ISTJ,"Does anyone can relate to this? I have a fanfic that I want to write I got everything covered but my writing sucks.

I'm a new writer and english is my 2nd language. Its really sucks when I got the ideas gathered and I manage to build up a story but in the process of converting it into words its already a pain in the ass.

You may think of me being whinning about it, its just if only I join or start practicing writing in my early teens. I'm a 20 year old who skipped a year of school because of online classes and quarantine. I wanted to use this opportunity to put down my thoughts into words."
RaxtusDragonMCPE,ISTJ,"When comes to making friends irl I'm having problems with it due to the fact that I'm an observant I tend to judge their personality to come up with a conclusion of what kind of person they are. I'm doing this to find people who are not going to ruined my life at the same time to benefit myself so I can get to know them. 

Heck, even My old friend (INTP) told me that I'm too tight that people can't even approach me they see me as an intimidating person. Sigh


Let me know if you can relate to this"
