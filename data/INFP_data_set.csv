fuckin-uhhhh,INFP,"infps are usually labeled as emotional healers bc since emotions aren’t seen as practical societally, we have to capitalize our naturally intense emotions/empathy in a certain way to make it useful to others so it’s seen as a redeemable quality rather than a con that can outweigh all the pros. thoughts?? 

(also im not the most healthy/developed of infps, apparently i might actually be another type that’s not doing so hot. just thought id put that out there)"
fuckin-uhhhh,INFP,"So I’m a first time watcher of this show by one of my co-worker. She was telling me about it and how good it was for her when she was a teenager, so I started watching it. from how excited she got from just talking about it, I knew it had to be some kind of good. 

Honestly I like the topics the show deals with overall and I’m only on episode 5, but Angela gives me a headache. She’s just so self absorbed, which I get is a running thing about teenagers but gah damn she’s annoying. 

Like this girl just cannot communicate to save her life and she’s constantly complaining and ruminating on the smallest problems. Plus, even at her “best” moments, or just not where’s shes not internalizing her self causes drama, she’s just flat out boring. Even when her friends are dealing with real LIFE shit that extends beyond just teenhood, she’s over here like “how am I FEELING about THEIR bad situation, gosh it’s affecting ME so much. Ugh being a teenager is sooo hard for me.”

I heard everyone raging about how much they love her and I’m curious, is it just from nostalgia value and personal relatability or is her character really that good? I feel like the only way I could end up liking her is if she ends up going through some major character development lol"
OshuSupreme,ENTP,"This is just a nice little love letter to ENFPs from an ENTP, you guys are so beautiful, amazing, funny, charismatic and smart.

•	Would you enjoy taking on a leadership position? Do you think you would be good at it? What would your leadership style be?

•	Are you coordinated? Why do you feel as if you are or are not? Do you enjoy working with your hands in some form? Describe your activity?

(Uhm, I mean if it gets done then I don’t care, sometimes I get lazy and push things to the side too often)

•	How good are you at strategizing? Do you easily break up projects into manageable tasks? Or do you have a tendency to wing projects and improvise as you go?

(I kinda just improvise and bullshit my way through things, I don’t really care much for strategizing, I end up pushing things to last

•	How attached are you to reality? Do you daydream often, or do you pay attention to what's around you? If you do daydream, are you aware of your surroundings while you do so?

(I daydream about my life and my dreams pretty often but for the most part, I have a super vivid imagination, but for the most part I do come back to earth often)

•	Imagine you are alone in a blank, empty room. There is nothing for you to do and no one to talk to. What do you think about?

(I would imagine things I could create most of the time or random scenarios like adventures or maybe just lay there and enjoy the time to myslef)

(Forever. And it’s pretty easy to change my mind once the argument is given a valid point )

(I don’t know? I guess they’re fine but I get over things fast)

•	Do you ever catch yourself agreeing with others just to appease them and keep the conversation going? How often? Why?

(Yah at times so people can shut the fuck up. Or even because I don’t care enough about the topic.)

•	Do you break rules often? Do you think authority should be challenged, or that they know better? If you do break rules, why?

(I tend to break the rules within my house only small ones like eating in my room because I genuinely believe it’s dumb, at work I follow the rules at times when the bosses leaving I would break the rules with a few coworkers to have fun, rules tend to be stupid but I will follow if needs be)"
OshuSupreme,ENTP,"All the other subs share things, like their rooms, selfie’s and all that other crap (Not saying we should)


But this sub just questions their type, complains about BS, troll and act like idiots


Y’all don’t have hobbies or anything? (Yes smart ass I know I’m doing it too)"
OshuSupreme,ENTP,"Appreciation post or whatever, hey you guys are pretty cool snd not just a bunch of sensitive crybabies like everyone says

A lot of the best game devs, philosophers, artist, authors and many more are INFPs, shoot, you have are more of polymath than us sometimes

Also you guys make up some of the best protagonist in my opinion, I hope you guys are all having a great day -ENTP ._."
ChickenTrick,INFP,"Honestly, I don't think this is an INFP thing, but I wonder how many others of us do this. 😆 Whenever I get a phone, I put it on silent immediately, and it stays that way unless I'm waiting on a very, *very* important call (which is extremely rare). If they really need to reach me, they can leave a message."
ChickenTrick,INFP,"I've been trying to find this quirky little song where a male and female sing about starting a band to become famous and him teaching her to play an instrument or something. The song also suggests they like each other but are too afraid to admit it. It's got a flute playing, as well as guitar and drums. They have New Zealand (maybe Australian but I'm pretty sure they were from NZ) accents. I cannot remember exact lyrics."
ChickenTrick,INFP,"First, I hope you're all doing well :) ❤️

As for my question... Sorry for the vague yet dramatic wording, but I'm (very slowly) developing a story with an ISFJ as a main character, and I just want to know your thought process when it comes to stuff like this. If someone does something unforgivable, how do you feel? How do you react? Does revenge cross your mind? And is ""unforgivable"" even a thing to you? There's a stereotype that ISFJs are so soft-hearted that they'll put up with anything out of love and habit, and I wonder just how true that is, and how far someone has to go before you strike back in whatever way you think is appropriate (even if it's not something as intense as ""revenge"")."
ChickenTrick,INFP,"""What do you want to be when you grow up?"" As a kid, what did you usually answer that question with?"
smolsammey,INFP,"I used to be, and sometimes still am, the most cheerful and optimistic person in the room.

But life fucked me up hard. I went through a lot of shits at such a young age. But despite having the urge to just end it all I am still trying my best in life, no matter what life throws at me.

I feel like I'm at the edge of a cliff and life is trying to push me off, but at the same time I am chained to an immovable rock and everytime life tries to push me off, the chains will resist it and keep me just on the edge. It's a battle between the two forces.

Though while I am still holding on for my dear life, I am extremely exhausted. I have friends I can lean on from time to time but I don't want it to be a one sided relationship.

So here I am, looking for someone I can be transparent with and someone I can exchange stories with."
smolsammey,INFP,"I am an 18 years old INFP male.

I've never met another ESTJ in my life and I would love to have some to help guide me.

When I first found out about ESTJs, it piqued my interest. It reminded me of ying and yang. The INFP have strong Fi and Ne but they still have Te and Si. The same is true for ESTJ just that the functions are reversed.

My life has been shit. Well not all of it but still, it is shit. If I were to publish a book about my life it would be a sad book. And I don't want that. I wanna say fuck you life. Fuck you childhood trauma. Fuck you eczema. Fuck you depression. Fuck you anxiety.

I want to battle it all and thrive, succeed, be happy. But yknow a strong will is not enough. I get days where I succumb into the existential dread. Getting through it on my own is kinda hard and I tend to give up easily.

I already have a rough idea on what I should do but the steps to get there is a little bit fuzzy. So if you're willing to help me out on my journey, give me your opinions and advices, make a new friend along the way, go ahead and pop into my dm.

A heads up, as a typical INFP I tend to disappear from the world. If I disappear for a day (as in not reply to dms) then that means I'm just recharging and needed some space for myself. But longer than that I'm just being a bitch so don't be shy to spam me lol."
ItzzSiren,INFP,"idk wth am i lol...

i took the test 3 times, and got 7w6 twice and once 7w8.. once 4w5 randomly.

just took it again and got..

**You are most likely a** type 7 (the enthusiast) **with 7w6 wing.**

( i'm 100% sure i'm INFP)

&#x200B;

i'm an introvert, but people think i'm an extrovert, i can be social, but i get drained. i'm also not very emotional.. as i have only a 6% preference for feelings over thinking.

ItzzSiren,INFP,"hello. i took the enneagram test multiple times i keep getting type 7. it's weird because it's not related to INFP's i heard it's kinda rare.

&#x200B;

\^ these are 3 diff test results.

can someone explain to me what would an INFP type 7 look like?

i'll talk about myself a little..

i'm an introvert who's ambivert, i'm kinda bubbly, funny, i hate negativity and being sad/anxious so i do something or try to change the subject because these things can exhaust me mentally, i like to keep things entertaining, I HATE the feeling of being bored. and try to find the smallest thing to do. daydreaming a lot. i also withdraw from reality at home sometimes for the whole week-days and just leave on weekends, people assume i'm an extrovert and very social when they see me when im actually introverted and sometimes awkward with people. maybe it's just what i think and it's not what people see. my close friends know prefer to stay home a lot. i become kinda vibrant in social situations but get exhausted quick. i mirror the person in front of me mostly, if he's being nice and bubbly i become that, if he's awkward, weird, i tend to be awkward and say random things. i hate drama, i hate manipulation, i sometimes worry if i gave a bad impression, sometimes i confront my friends and tell them how i felt about something if i'm mad at them and if i dislike the person i avoid them, i hate negativity but also hate toxic positivity and pretend everything is ok.  i'm kinda logical i tend to put my emotions aside when dealing with something serious, even tho my i'm Fi i just tell myself logic would be the best option here. if im hurt by someone i  get into my head on why he did that? especially if i didn't do anything at all.

srrry, i blabbed a lot. if someone would explain that'd be awesome!"
ItzzSiren,INFP,"hello fellow INFPS!

so.. i took the enneagram test once when drunk i got 5, and 7 to be second highest. i knew something was wrong lol. i took the test 2 times after that and i got 7w8 (the realist) so my curiosity took me to the internet to check INFP's 7w8 / INFP 7w8 people and.... it's very uhh.. empty? i can't seem to find a lot of topics about it and why we get mistaken for being ENFP's or Extroverts to others when we're actually introverts, i do become social with my inner circle of friends who i feel comfortable with doesn't matter if it's let's say a party or a quiet place but the usual is i always stay home lol. i also use T depending on the situation (INFP : You have slight preference of Feeling over Thinking (12%) ) i don't rely on my feelings as much, when it MUST be logical i use logic. (argument, with friends, about why things happened etc)

&#x200B;

i really wanna know your thoughts about INFP's enneagram 7? how r they like? is it rare or odd somewhat?

&#x200B;

(something random that i guess worth to mention....on the PDB website, i found that Coraline Jones from the movie Coraline  is INFP 7w8 which is interesting cuz i really liked her and related to her.)

Zomberz_04,INFP,"I think the dlc could’ve been an interesting way to see the growth of the clan and possibly the deterioration of Eivør’s mental health (think something like Ragnar). I’d be fine with waiting until the end of the main story, so long as I got to continue Eivør. What do you all think?"
Zomberz_04,INFP,I’ve set up a scene where one of my characters explains a favourite story of his. I’m just wondering how I would structure that so it’s obvious he’s telling a separate story.

Moonsight,INFP,"Life has been an exhausting struggle for what seems like an awfully long time: I persist by the grace of God, alone. I love the old hymns I grew up with, and would like to ask if you might be able to share some of the sadder, more contemplative ones you know with me. 

One such a hymn I've had playing in my mind over and over these past few days is ""Nearer, My God to Thee."" 

Such music helps me to ground myself, and helps me to remember that God has a plan for us all... myself included."
Moonsight,INFP,"I saw a meme on r/infp the other day. This one, to be exact: https://i.redd.it/76nahf21fao51.png

It spoke to me. I'm a man in my thirties, and I'm a lawyer in New York City. I specialize in immigration law, and the Violence Against Women Act. It pays well. And it's rewarding work. I get to protect and help abused women and refugees... I get to leave the world a better place than I found it. 

All day long, I wear this mask of charm, calm, and confidence. I have to be intimidating to immigration officers, comforting to abused clients, and confident in front of my paralegals. I have to be the kind of person who is listened to, when they speak. I'm pretending to be that person right now. 

But when I get home, I shower, and curl up into a ball on my bed, with my stuffed animals, and retreat into the same dissociative, depression coping-mechanism, fantasy universe that I've been retreating into every single night of my life since middle school. 

I'm sharing this, in part because it's therapeutic for me to get this out, but also because I see so many people here who are just like me. I only just found r/infp earlier this week. It scares me a little bit, to know you all exist. I almost don't want you all to exist, so that you don't have to feel the way I do.

You'd look at me in the streets of NYC, on the subway, in the courtroom, and you'd never imagine for one second that this guy is in any way, shape or form like you. I'm sitting here browsing reddit when I should be grinding a brief, and asking myself ""what's wrong with me?"" just like you might be. 

I need help. Maybe we all do. And you know, from what I understand, there are no better helpers out there than INFPs. 

I'm tempted to delete this all after typing it, as the compulsion tends to be with us. 

But I also want you to know, you're not alone. Really, you're not. Even when everyone around you seems put together - they could just be great actors. I try to be one, and sometimes even succeed at it. 

Maybe this is something you need to see today. And if you're really at the end of your rope, in the way I often feel, in the way I'm feeling today even, maybe we can talk - I'd be happy to listen. 

I hope we can all listen, and discuss our feelings. It's something I wish someone would do for me."
