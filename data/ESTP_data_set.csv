Giveaway_Guy,ESTP,"My three highest types are 7, 2, and 8, where 7 and 2 were tied. How do you figure out what your ""wing"" is? Like, am I 7w2 or 7w8...and what does that mean?"
Giveaway_Guy,ESTP,"1,000% ESTP here. For my whole adult life, there has never been anyone I've met quite like me. I was always more social, adventurous, spontaneous, care-free, figure-it-out-as-I-go, determined, resilient, etc etc etc than everyone around me. I'm not Superman or anything, but I don't sweat the small stuff, I think. Whatever. Anyway...

I took the Myers Briggs test a bunch of years ago and got ESTP. Neat. I had no idea what that meant but it was interesting to read something that described me so well written by someone who had never met me. I never did anything with it because I figured it was along the same lines as astrology, which I don't give any attention to.

Then about a year ago, for whatever reason, I started seeing the four-letter MBTI personality labels popping up in various places. I guess it was gaining traction. Then, just a few days ago, I found this sub. All I can is wow! It's not a bad wow, but not a positive wow either. It's a...holy crap kinda wow. It's certainly interesting to finally see how other people like me handle themselves and learn what other people think of people like me.

Like I said, I don't know what to make of it. Is this sub a silly ESTP circle jerk, similar to what /r/murica is to the United States? Or is it a philosophical community to genuinely discuss ESTP? Do we celebrate or commiserate? Or maybe all the above?"
Giveaway_Guy,ESTP,"I realize that cost is probably a huge factor, but cruise ships do it for 2,000 to 5,000 people at a time and remain profitable, why can't cities along the coast do it when they have millions of people who could benefit from it? Is it something that is possible only at small scale? Obviously I don't know anything about this, but wouldn't California benefit from it immensely?"
Giveaway_Guy,ESTP,"Everyone I ask says the same thing: Craiglist or 800-GOT-JUNK. 

I don't want to put it up on Craigslist or FB Marketplace again because each time I do, even for free, people don't show up or if they do, they don't have the means to transport it. I don't have an extra $500 to pay for junk removal either, so that's out. I've read that landfills won't take them. Even the local hot tub outlets said they don't know how to dispose of them."
Giveaway_Guy,ESTP,"I visited 2 years ago and had some delicious Maui onion-flavored potato chips. I don't remember the brand. Frito-Lay makes them and I can get them at my local Target...but are those the same? Is there a better, local store I can order from? I'd even be fine with sending someone local some money to ship me a few bags!"
Giveaway_Guy,ESTP,"Whenever there is a hurricane, tornado, earthquake, or something manmade, I hear about people packing up and taking off to help with cleanup or rescue efforts. I know fundraising and donations help too, but I'm a capable, able-bodied, healthy person and I'd like to help where I'd be more useful. Whenever the next whatever happens, how do I become a part of it? Contact the local police departments? Red Cross or other organizations? Just show up?"
Giveaway_Guy,ESTP,"A typical CCTV system will record videos two different ways:

 - Low quality continuous recording (640x480, 2fps)
 - High quality event recording (2560x1440, 15fps)

During a burglary, intruder will walk in front of different cameras at different times over the course of 10 minutes. The cameras will switch from low quality to high quality and back to low quality, depending on when motion is detected.

I exported about 10 clips from the system and I'd like to assemble them in Premiere but it doesn't seem to know how to handle it.

If the clips start off low quality, the clip is detected as being 640x480, then as soon as high quality kicks in, Premiere appears to scale the video out of the frame without changing the respecting the resolution change and so the video data is apparently lost. Scaling the clip doesn't salvage anything.

And vice versa, if a clip begins high quality and go to low quality, Premiere turns it into a distorted green color bands.

Regular media players have never had a problem showing clips that do this...is there any way to make Premiere play nice with them?

Here are some examples: https://imgur.com/a/U94u5ZT

- Windows 10 Pro
- Premeire Pro 14.2.0
- Footage specs change
- H.265/HVEC (I believe)"
Giveaway_Guy,ESTP,"Originally a Siren Head video with Siren Head replaced with the coffin dancers. They can be seen far off in the distance and look to be 500 feet tall. The coffin dance song sounds to be playing far off into the distance as well.

Something like this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjNr3nfi5ic"
Giveaway_Guy,ESTP,"The cooling fans in my dad's Escape run a *lot.* Like, they'll run for several minutes, turn off for 30 or seconds, and then turn back on again for another several minutes. Rinse & repeat. Sometimes they'll just run perpetually until the engine is shut off.

I've checked the temperature of the engine with a scan tool and it hovers around 184°. I replaced the temperature sensor for the heck of it too, but there was no change.

My dad took it to the dealership to get it checked out but they said they didn't find anything wrong. My dad complains constantly about how the dealership were a bunch of idiots, etc etc etc because he swears the fans aren't supposed to run as often as they do.

Thoughts?"
Frosty-Cornflakes,ESTP," Because I fucking said s-

Superior social skills. Superior dominance. Innate dexterity & perspicacity. Albeit all that, intelligence amply present.

Therefore, the best type.

Besides, all the coolest characters in anime are ESTP which are mistyped as ENTJ 😂😂

Esdeath - ESTP 8w7

Sukuna - ESTP 8w7

Escanor - ESTP 3w4

Yumeko - ESTP 7w8

Who I miss lmao

*brainwashing complete*"
Frosty-Cornflakes,ESTP," ⭐ESTP

\-Shadow Si: My external sensory experience has impacted me negatively to such a degree that I have retreated inward. This is somewhat unnatural for me, and I am feeling unfulfilled and frustrated as a result.

\-Critical Te: In pursuit of the action and stimulus I crave, I am resorting to alternative means. I am pouring myself into my work/hobbies. I am experiencing my interests indirectly: engaging with them by proxy. I will research, collect and/or maintain the things I care about.

\-Blind-spot Fi: I am unaware of how desperately unnatural my experience/lifestyle truly feels. I am suppressing and/or repressing my emotions to such a degree that I am clueless as to what I *truly* need/want.

\-Demonic Ne: I am looking for satisfaction in all the wrong places. I am drowning out my inner pain and discomfort with many kinds of external distractions. Anything is better than motionlessness."

Frosty-Cornflakes,ESTP,"It's funny. I've humbled over four ENTJ 8w7's this week alone. And by humble, I mean, obliterated, scolded, outwitted, outsmarted, checkmate. Retards. I can sense their initial disdain when they first talk to me, I allow them to think that they baited me, but it is I that have baited them.

I think ESTP's are the greatest MBTI type, and everything mainstream about ESTP is all a disgusting stereotype. I say this from the deepest core of my being.

Fuck this ESTP ""chad"" bullshit, even though we are chad. lol

&#x200B;

Edit:

""We are the greatest. Stop being shy.

Yeah  bro. Genius level IQ. Insane social ability. Fight ability. Girl  ability. Why wouldn't these fucking losers be  jealous??????????????????????

I  don't say this out of arrogance or pride. But annoyance. Fucking  inferior hoes looking down on those who are superior? FUCK OFF."""
shayaharon,ENFP,"Am I the only one who think that this app is kinda useless and even stupid? I mean, my cousin (esfp) showed me some videos and all I see is narcissistic guys who think that they are so fucking perfect. 
It's like, they're trying to be 'funny' yet very attractive at the same time naturally, but it comes out so cringy. They copy other's stuff and dance weirdly. Not creative, educational or necessary at all. Just trying to look good and cool in front others, it's a waste of time... Some Tiktoks are actually good like making food/nice jokes and cool facts but all these 'look at me' videos, God they make me feel so uncomfortable...."
shayaharon,ENFP,"I'll tell a little about myself 

I like traveling, biking, activities which include adrenaline but I don't do it all the time, only when I plan it with my parents who like extreme too (especially my step dad who is INTJ).

At anything, no matter when or where, I live in a kind of a fantasy world. I create characters, plot, even a country, and place it in the real world. I don't like talking about it, in fact, I didn't tell that to anybody, but that's what I'm doing. I also like creating another new character in a movie I like, and change the movie plot a little bit so the new character will fit well.

I write a book, it includes lots of psychology and crime. My main characters are ISTP, ESFP and ENTP. I don't share any of it until it's done, cause I believe in working hard in silence for the perfect version I can make.

I'm very curious about my personality and stuff that I like. For example, I really like music, so I usually know when the song came (year), the singer, the singer's story behind the song... Also drinks and stacks, yes it sounds stupid but I like rolling on wiki to see where it was made and what year it came out. I tend to get into characters I make without telling to anyone, that's what makes me a little 'unknown' cause one day I can turn out X and one day Y. My opinions about stuff can change a lot, only a few things I believe that would never change, but I don't like using words like ""forever, never, every, all..."" words.

I know I'm introvert, my inner world is so interesting. That country I made has rules, history, wars, cities, languages, culture and nature beauty. I don't always play like I live there. I do like being here and now sometimes. I can be a really nice person. I have strong feelings and I can connect to things which people might found weird, but whatever. I usually don't show my feelings or talk about them, only with a very few people. If the 'friends' of mine had to guess my type, some would say ESTP, ENFP and INTJ. I know it sounds really weird, but I tend to be more excited and extrovert around people. My best friend might say INTJ, cause I'm very serious with my studies, kind of perfectionist, but also very deep.
About the enneagram, it's usually 7w8, or 1w9. I also have the SX. I used to have enneagram 4 in an unhealthy way, but it changed."

shayaharon,ENFP,"Idk... I just wanna know. Sometimes I feel the need for that even though I don't think I'm an INFJ, but I do like using Fe when I feel down."
shayaharon,ENFP,"That's it. I got it. As a girl, most boys don't get my point. I like playing P4, I like violence/crime/bloody movies, wrestling, taking risks and I don't mind getting dirty and I don't like experience or popular clothes/jewelry, I wear what's comfortable and look good in my eyes. But I'm not a boy(!).

The fact that I'm not a dramatic/gentle/sweetie girl, doesn't make me a bad cold girl. The fact that saying ""I love you"" or stuff like that is really hard for me and makes me uncomfortable, doesn't mean I don't like you. Or being rational/quiet/sarcastic/ a little cold girl, doesn't make me a piece of shit.

I just want to try, to find someone who will truly understand me so I can feel more calm. My parents know exactly who I am so I feel comfortable around them... But I don't want people to think that I'm a bad person. Some told me that I'm kind of a ""Tomboy"".... I usually don't care about what people say, but this one actually makes sense. I guess I need another istp boyfriend cause he might understand me more than all. Plus, Idk why but when boys show me love I take it weird. I don't know how to react. I just don't want people to think that I'm a savage robot. Cause I need people in my life, not a lot, but important ones. I know I look good, and I have 95+/100 grades... It's all about my personality. 

ISTP boys and especially girls, how do you deal with your feelings? How you show them not in a weird/looking fake way even though it's real?"
shayaharon,ENFP,"I'm an ISTP 7w8 girl, and I met another guy two days ago who is ESTP 7w. His Se is so fucking high it's hilarious. He's a friend of my friend and he came to the teenage club with my friend. I liked his energy and it seemed like he liked mine too, so we decided to meet again yesterday. He lives near to my city, so we met in the city between. We went on the streets and he didn't stop looking for action, something exciting. His 7 is clear af. His moto in life is to ""live here and now, and take advantage of any opportunity for fun and a great time"". He was the one who talked the most, which was so relaxing cause I usually don't know what to talk about.

At first - we walked. All this trip. Walking. Everything was spontaneous. He took me to a ""Try Beers"" place, near the wall, and we're only 17 lol. It was fun and actually we both drink beers sometimes anyways. Then we sneaked into the rouf of the mall and watched the beautiful view, but then those guards took us away from there. We like to try new stuff, and you know, energy drinks.... So we just bought like 5 different types and tried them out. Also bought my favorite video game. I told him ""you know what? Let's take the first bus which comes to the station, without knowing where it'll go"". And he liked it. So finally we arrived to the beach! Watched it from the edge of the cliff and started screaming. One weirdo came to me and tried to get me into his car, so he protected me from that stupid. I felt really comfortable to be who I am around him. 

He's craziest than me. The craziest thing he did was to ride his bike to another far away city, and he slept under benches and slides.... Too high Se with E7. But I liked him. I love ESTPs who give me attention and we can hang out. We decided to take the first train which comes to the station next week, after my final test."
shayaharon,ENFP,"I'm just kidding guys. There will be no commissions, no arrogant shit, no 'high words'. I'm just another istp who likes to make fun about those who pretend to be INFJ, the smartest, mysterious, prettiest, worthest people in the world.

I'm kidding guys. Be who you are God damn it."
shayaharon,ENFP,"I'll give you my top 3:
3. Jesus- He's emotional, cares, loves, and protect. 
2. Carol - She's the bravest, caring, amazing woman. 
1. Daryl - Come on, you can't not love him!

My least favorites are Negan and The king.
No spoilers guys!"

Tagging/using spoilers just in case."
Dziolszka,ESTP,"So I have bought a Heroes VII but when i've checked my library it's not showing up at all. Checked my order and I got an info that game is now showing up in the library - which is not the case.

Should i submit a ticket or they just have some issues with the sync and it's taking them more time to simply add a game to the library?"
Dziolszka,ESTP,"Hello fellow Simmers, after a few years I want to return to TS3. Do you have any CC/mods recommendation? From mods I remember that Master Controller was the thing back then. As for CC, I'm into alpha hairstyles, skins, eyes, makeup, clothes - not necessary but it's a nice to have. Not interested in buy mode. I like realistic gameplay."

tnew12,ESTP,"I have the toughest time pumping every 3-4 hrs. I want to give her breast milk, I want to have a decent supply, and I also want to meet her emotional needs. It seems like I can only choose one. When I try to put her down, she starts crying and doesn't stop until I pick her back up. She's only a month so I can't let her cry it out, but I know theres technically nothing wrong with her. My pumping sessions take about an hour, but I only pump in 2-7 min spurts between me needing to get her- so I'm actually pumping for about 15-20 minutes and getting ~40 ml. 

Its hard for my to care for her with the bottles attached, even though I have a portable pump (ameda Mya and Spectra). When I'm in the rocking chair I try to balance her on my legs but it seems unsafe, she's ripped the flanges off me (OUCH!) and stresses me out. Actually, this whole situation stresses me out and I end up crying during/after pumping cuz it seems like too much.

Update: thanks everyone who's given a response! It seems that I have a lot of options once she's a bit older when she has neck control and can play. At this time I'll practice giving myself some grace and give her to my husband when I can to make pumping less stressful"
tnew12,ESTP,"I need your advice. In the same day I can range from 80ml or 15ml per side/pp.

I'm 3 weeks post partum and pumping every 3 hours during the day and 5 hrs at night ( around 7 pumping sessions a day). I pump for about 15-20 minutes. I've remeasured flanges, replaced pump parts, eating oatmeal, and drinking lots of water.  

I have the medla symphony. I do let down twice for 5 minutes but I never get to the 'spray stage' unless I do compressions the whole time. I'm also at the highest comfortable setting, but could that still be too low? Most of the time after my 20 min session I have to do hand compressions to get rest out.

At my last 20 min pumping session I was able to get 25ml out. I'm very disheartened and an very tempted to fully switch to formula cuz if this is all I get, whats the point? https://imgur.com/uztyTlk.jpg"
tnew12,ESTP,"I know breastfeeding can be a challenge but this hurts way too much, like a 9/10 in pain when latched and about 5/10 when not latched/when touched. I'm alternating using hydrogel pads, frozen pads, lanolin, and motrin to help with the pain. 

The base of my nipple is very red and I know my latch is incorrect/not deep enough because my nipple looks angled like lipstick once she's done.

I winced and cried during the last latch and decided tonight I'm supplementing with formula until I can see the pediatrician and lactation consultant tomorrow morning. Idk what i'm really asking for but I need support.

*Update*: I had my appt with the lactation consultant. I have 'short nipples' and partial invernted nipple (dimpled) and Lil Spud doesnt have a tongue tie. Because of the damage from trying to breastfeed, I have mild cracks and bruising, but it should heal quickly! We're going to continue to supplement for the next week and I'll continue to hand express/feed her what I collect.

I learned more about massaging my breasts before starting to express to help the let down. I was given breast shields for comfort, a dropper to give her expressed milk, and lots of encouragement to keep me mentally sane. I meet with the LC on Thurs and next Tues. Thanks everyone and keep the advice coming!!! 💛"
tnew12,ESTP,"I have a dotted email first.lastname@gmail.com and someone across the country has the same undotted firstlastname@gmail.com.

Sometimes I get really important emails from her school/employers with personal info and I'm not sure what emails she gets of mine. I try to forward the email to her undotted email, but it winds back up in my inbox. When I tell the sender this, the message sometimes comes back to me, other times it doesn't.

Based on the FAQ, gmail doesnt 'care' about dots and having an email this similar is not supposed to happen. But here we are! I'm not sure how to get these emails to her.

fuckedasaplant,ESTP,"Congratulations! You have found yourself in possession of your own unique ESTP unit. Or rather, you have been lured into possession of said unit by the bright lights, excitable hopping/bouncing and happy-go-lucky chirping. This unit will bring you a lifetime of enjoyment w/ proper handling and care so please read thoroughly lest it runs away and causes you heartbreak.

# Getting Started

Your ESTP unit should arrive pre-activated and ready to zoom around and inspect/interact with your environment. In case your ESTP has not yet been activated, please complete the following:

1. Set the unit down in an open area with a variety of interesting objects in its field of vision.
2. Dangle a tasty treat (such as bacon) in front of it and let the scent waft into its processing unit.
3. Wait. The unit should start up and snatch the treat out of your hand. Give it a couple seconds to warm up but be ready for the sudden flurry of activity once it has received adequate sustenance.
4. \[WARNING\] If at this time the unit does not start up, please do not hypothesize about all the things that might be wrong with it. This will deplete the unit’s energy and cause it to sink further into inactivity and will require significant effort and energy to re-activate.

# About your ESTP unit

Your ESTP comes pre-programmed with the following traits and functions:

* Endless arsenal of fun and exciting activities to engage in.
* Irreverent sense of humor, will laugh and make fun of anything, but will attempt, for the most part, to not hurt or offend anyone seriously.
* Naturally equipped to survive and thrive in dangerous/stressful situations.
* Will get along with most other units, but will only grow close to the ones that understand and respect its freedom.
* Extremely observant and can accurately identify motivations and discrepancies in behavior and attitude in surrounding units/individuals.
* A love of freedom and extreme independence.

# Care and Maintenance

1. Do not attempt to box your unit into an enclosed area with little to no stimulation, it will break out and run away and never return.
2. Play with your unit frequently and give it free space to roam in order to strengthen it’s bond with you.
3. Do not attempt to invoke an Everlasting Bond with the unit too soon, it will freak out and run away and never return.

Note:

An Everlasting Bond can only be successfully invoked once the unit has acquired enough data on the consistency and quality of your care and handling. Free space to roam and do as it pleases is integral to the successful invocation of the Everlasting Bond, and any attempts to curtail its freedom will result in the immediate flight of the unit.

# Modes

**Default**

The default setting for this unit will include a steady stream of energy, curiosity in its surroundings, and constant background analysis. The unit is generally friendly with strangers and friends alike, and will most likely be humming along, ready to engage in amusement or play.

**Adrenaline Death Monkey**

Certain amusements can trigger this mode, when triggered, any attempts to turn it off will be fruitless, just allow it to run its course. Excited and energetic, the unit will throw itself into the usually somewhat dangerous activity at hand with little apparent regard for its own safety. While it can be concerning to watch the unit flirt with death, do not be alarmed, ESTP units come well-equipped to handle most emergency situations and will most likely emerge from its activity unharmed and exhilarated.

**Dead Food Coma Puppy**

Appearing dead but is just relaxed, the unit is most likely winding down and recharging from an intense sprint in Adrenaline Death Monkey mode, please leave ample food and water nearby and leave be. The unit should spring back into activity eventually.

**X-Ray Analysis**

While the unit is constantly running analysis on the data it has gathered in the background, when it is in X-Ray Analysis mode, it will actively scan the individual in question to build a real-time assessment of the individual’s current State-of-Being. If this mode was triggered by an offense caused to the unit, quickly mitigate the damage done before the unit hurts you with its words. If, however, this mode was triggered by conflict involving the individual but not the unit, the unit will most likely provide a sound analysis of the situation at hand and solutions to remedy any problems present.

**Existential Depression**

Can be triggered by sustained periods in Adrenaline Death Monkey mode, or a sustained period of lack of stimulation. If your unit appears uninterested in its surroundings and lethargic, this could be a sign of Existential Depression mode, attempt to turn off its central processing functions and once it starts up again, gently remind it of the meaningful bonds it has formed with you and other individuals/units. Good food, cleaning, and sunlight should also help.

**Fuck Off**

Fuck off can be more accurately defined as a trigger rather than a mode, if you attempt to curtail your unit’s freedom or do not provide enough stimulation or play, the unit will Fuck Off and leave without a backwards glance to find a more suitable environment for itself. The chances for a Fuck Off will decrease with more play, stimulation and a later development phase of the unit, but the possibility for a Fuck Off will always be non-zero.

Pauline___,ESTP,"Okay guys, I want to know if the truth bomb I'm about to unleash is a good idea. I might end up with a complementary roommate 👀

Some background: My bestie (ENTP, 29M) has been in a codependent relationship (with INFP, 28F) riddled with red flags since before we even met. They moved in way too soon because he was evicted from his shared apartment, after only knowing each other for a couple of months. They both have some issues and troubled pasts so none of them is very Ehm... Emotionally stable. They broke up earlier this year, finally, but got back together and moved into a new apartment last month.

Now I like her as a person, I like him as a person, but they make a horrible combination with very little common ground and a lot of annoyance and miscommunication. Being the gay best friend, they both come to me to vent. 

The issue: he was never really satisfied with the relationship, but totally willing to work on himself and help her advance too. However, after years and years of trying to make it work, she has not done any of the work and he, having grown as a person himself, feels like she's holding him back big time. She gets angry when he brings that up, but he's the only one with an income and ambitions. She has been failing classes in university for about 8 or 9 years now. He's hesitant to give up everything they built, but also dreads a life where he wasted his best years on a mediocre relationship he feels no attraction or validation in.

The truthbomb: over the last 48 hours, I've been jotting down all the things he says he hates about her. That's 19 individual things. In 48 hours. And that's across the board, from never having privacy ever, to bad sex, to having to walk on eggshells not to make her mad at him. He has even mentioned himself that she's a walking red flag. I really want to present him with that list and an ultimatum: he has to name AT LEAST 10 things he likes or admires about her, or else he has to look for a backup apartment because let's face it, there's no way this shit's gonna last.

The however: I don't really want to be accused of meddling like the bossy person I can be. I do think it's the best for both of them, but Idk if it's my place to tell them that. And being Ne-dom, he's not a patient person, so there's a chance he reads my list, something clicks, and my hobbyroom might have a new occupant for the upcoming months...

By the way: I can't post this on the ENTP or MBTI subs because he's an active member there"
Pauline___,ESTP,"Hi everyone, I was wondering if some of you experience the same thing? This is about Se and Fe so if you're an ENFJ lurking, please feel free to answer too.

I just can't watch real violence or blood without having a physical reaction to it. Like getting very nauseated and/or feeling punched in the stomach myself. Any video portraying abuse is exactly the same. I will feel like that hit dog, that guy with a broken leg or that chick going through a c-section in a medical documentary show.

I think this has to do with Se and Fe. I have called it body empathy because its purely for physical pain, emotional pain is way less bad to me.

I don't have this when it's a scripted film or show, because I know it's acting and special effects. I also don't have it if it's martial arts (because it's voluntary) or if it's only talked about, not shown.

It is a little bit of an upside when watching certain interactive videos tho 😏 but again only with the real ones of couples filming themselves having fun, not the scripted ones. 

Do some of you experience this too? Or is it just me being squeamish as all fuck.

Edit: apparently, it's called somatic empathy"
Pauline___,ESTP,"Hi there :) 

I believe that we as humans all have a bandwidth of extraversion, rather than just being socially extraverted, introverted or ambiverted as a category.

On the one hand, you have days in a row where you can hang out with people without wanting an afternoon or evening by yourself. Let's call those E-days On the other hand you have days in a row where you can hang out by yourself without feeling bored or lonely, let's call those I-days.

My personal bandwidth is 2 I-days and 6 E-days. What's yours?"
Pauline___,ESTP,"Hey, my friend and I would love some of your insights on what type she may be. Right now we consider INTP, ENTP and ENFP. She's clearly on the Ne-Si axis, but when testing she has both very strong Ti and Fi, and weak Fe and Te.

How old are you? What's your gender? Give us a general description of yourself.

She is a 24 y/o student, currently living in the Netherlands. She's likely an enneagram 6w7. She's usually very playful and childish, but can be very serious and scholarly at other times.

Is there a medical diagnosis that may impact your mental stability somehow?

She has mild autism with occasional panic attacks

Describe your upbringing. Did it have any kind of religious or structured influence? How did you respond to it?

She was raised by a single mum. At 4 years old, her dad left without a trace, making her distrustful of men (she's very much a feminist because of this). Being a single mum in North Africa is hard and they emigrated to Europe from Egypt when she was 7 years old, living the expat life and thus moving quite a lot. She didn't grow up religious and considers herself agnostic.

What do you do as a job or as a career (if you have one)? Do you like it? Why or why not?

She studies theoretical physics, she'd love to be a researcher and do a PhD

If you had to spend an entire weekend by yourself, how would you feel? Would you feel lonely or refreshed?

she would sleep in past noon, being a night owl and probably played videogames until the wee hours if she didn't have to get up early. She'd probably relax for a bit, work on her homework, maybe do a bit of programming or gaming on the computer, maybe go visit the sauna or do mindfulness meditation. But she would probably grow bored quite quickly though. She's talkative and competitive, although she's shy and doesn't like crowds. She prefers to hang out one on one or in small groups up to 4 people.

What kinds of activities do you prefer? Do you like, and are you good at sports? Do you enjoy any other outdoor or indoor activities?

Squash is her sport of choice and she trains twice a week. She also does yoga at home (via youtube). She likes to keep active but isn't especially good at sports. It's the competition/game that she likes the most. This also translates into playing videogames and tabletop games. She's not really an outdoorsy person, she jokingly says she'll get lost 200 meters into the woods.

How curious are you? Do you have more ideas then you can execute? What are your curiosities about? What are your ideas about - is it environmental or conceptual, and can you please elaborate?

Her curiosity is through the roof. Anything can spark it and it \*must\* be researched thoroughly right now. Physics has been a major interest of her ever since her teenage years, but she also loves biology and watches a lot of documentaries.

Would you enjoy taking on a leadership position? Do you think you would be good at it? What would your leadership style be?

She doesn't like to be in the spotlight and prefers to just do her thing, without the responsibility over others gnawing in the back of her head. I asked her, she would hate to have a leadership role.

Are you coordinated? Why do you feel as if you are or are not? Do you enjoy working with your hands in some form? Describe your activity?

About average (except when it comes to directions, she's bad at those). Working with her hands isn't really her thing.

Are you artistic? If yes, describe your art? If you are not particular artistic but can appreciate art please likewise describe what forums of art you enjoy. Please explain your answer.

Not at all, and art has never really had her interest either. She can build you a mean gaming computer though.

What's your opinion about the past, present, and future? How do you deal with them?

The past wasn't super pretty and it definitely made it's mark on her. For example, she has very strong boundaries which she's very vocal about and will get mad if you cross them. She lives in her head a lot, fantasizing about the future. The present is just... there. But doesn't get a lot of attention otherwise.

\*this is getting quite long so I'll pick and choose the last couple of questions\*

Do you control others, even if indirectly? How and why do you do that?

She's very vocal about her opinions and will debate you if she thinks you are wrong. She doesn't really have a filter, thus can be quite blunt.

How good are you at strategizing? Do you easily break up projects into manageable tasks? Or do you have a tendency to wing projects and improvise as you go?

She's definitely a winger, jumping from curiosity to curiosity, often losing track of time. Deadlines are her mortal enemy, because stuff is never truly finished.

What are your fears? What makes you uncomfortable? What do you hate? Why?

She's shy and crowds make her uncomfortable, so does being in the spotlight. She also is apprehensive of men (yeah I know, the physics field is full of those, so that might be a controversial career choice). Things other people might find scary, like heights and spiders and dentists, don't scare her at all though.

How long do you take to make an important decision? And do you change your mind once you've made it?

Minds are changed every day; my friend is not one to stick with a plan for long.

Do you ever catch yourself agreeing with others just to appease them and keep the conversation going? How often? Why?

Never. She said: why would I want to keep a conversation going with someone who needs appeasing? We can either agree to disagree and switch topics, or they can go ef themselves, I won't be budged.

Do you break rules often? Do you think authority should be challenged, or that they know better? If you do break rules, why?

She breaks rules constantly, but gets away with it because she looks very feminine, innocent and pretty, with colourful clothes and make-up. She thinks many rules are stupid and are only there because stupid people are bad at keeping themselves alive otherwise."
Pauline___,ESTP,"Have you guys ever had a moment where someone typed you in their head without asking you, and then named you as an example of a type that you weren't?

Not that long ago, a friend of mine pointed me out as a perfect example of an actually healthy ENFP, who had both feed on the ground, was punctual and organized and got shit done. And I was like: why tf do you think I'm ENFP?! And he proceeded to name all sorts of stuff that is actually linked to being an Enneagram 7 (the most common type for all ExxPs) and told me how proud he was of me that I did not show any of the pitfalls ENFPs have. Then I said ""well, that's because I'm ESTP, with my own pitfalls and all"" and he just wouldn't believe me because I don't fit the stereotype (that's based on US heterosexual males in their early 20s, and I fit none of those demographics). He wouldn't believe in functions either (typing on stereotypes) so hey, what's a woman to do but just let him be, he'll stumble into the truth at some point. And if not, well he can idolize me as the ENFP without pitfalls all he wants."

Pauline___,ESTP,"Hi there :)

I know, guilty pleasures are not actually guilty, just things that people wouldn't expect from you, looking at the rest of your life style choices. But I would love to know, what are some guilty pleasures you got that are either super stereotypical, or very far removed from the stereotype of your type. I'll go first.

Very stereotypical: although I don't really watch TV at all, I absolutely love the show Ninja Warrior

Contra-stereotypical: I love baking, especially cupcakes and cookies."
Pauline___,ESTP,"So, from what I've seen in my friend group, there's basically two groups of people when it comes to physical health during the pandemic. 

Group one actually got healthier because no more parties, no cake, no booze, no restaurants... All opportunities to indulge are basically gone and the world is boring so we jog/yoga/bike a lot. 

The second group actually has seen a decline in their health (the famous ""corona kilos"") because sports facilities have been closed for 10/12 months now (with 2 months opening in August and September and then closing again) and team sports have been prohibited. Also, what's cooking?! Ordering pizza helps the economy ;)

I'm personally in the first group (although I exercise 3 times a week now rather than 5 times because of the ban on team sports), but I'm not necessarily more healthy than last year. A year of no booze, no cake, no post-pub midnight snacks has made me slim to the point of being scrawny, and there wasn't that much of me to begin with. That's not just the lack of opportunities to indulge, it's also that I become very, very lethargic from being alone. Living alone and working from home depletes my energy super fast, so I often just skip meals because I can't be arsed."

GymAndAnime,ISTP,"So I passed my initial medical examination, as well as the second MEPS visit. I'm supposed to ship out this Tuesday.

I finally got a haircut today, after months, and noticed what appears to be Folliclitis on my scalp.

Obviously the MEPS doctor's didnt see it because my long hair was covering it. But what happens when they buzz my hair at BMT and they notice it? Will they say anything? Can I get discharged/sent home?

I'm afraid of leaving to BMT and then getting sent home for something like this. Idk if in overreacting."

GymAndAnime,ISTP,"What time is PT generally done during basic training? Or does it vary? And what time do they generally wake you up?

I just want an estimate, so I can get my body uses waking up and working at these times. I'm about 9 days out from shipping."
GymAndAnime,ISTP,"I know this may seem like an odd question. Basically because of Covid, they are reducing the number of runs during Air Force Boot Camp. It's a total of 8.5 weeks, but we are only doing about 3 run days, 1 being a PT test at the start of boot camp, and another being another PT test at the end. They test us in the 1.5 mile run. I'm going to go in running about 9:15 on my 1.5 mike but not sure if I can mantain that without proper training. We won't be able to go out on runs on our ""own time"" because we won't have any.

So my question is, given this scenario, what can I do to retain some of my conditioning? Let's say you're limited to the space besides your bed."
GymAndAnime,ISTP,Anyone leaving on 4/20? Trying to see if theirs a discord group.
GymAndAnime,ISTP,Do they give you caffeine in BMT and are you allowed to hit the gym after class at tech School?

Any advice for this job? What are some things I should know before going in? I've never worked on generators or engines before, so I would like a good foundation of the concepts so I'm ready for tech school. 

And if anyone had this job in the past. What path did you take once you got of the AF? I want to gain as many skills as possible to be marketable in the civilian world."
Kasilyn13,ENFP,"I was surprised to hear a few ppl talking in ENFP about how their ISTP husbands are home bodies and not really up for adventures, including ones that don't involve interacting with other people. Now obviously we shouldn't over stereotype and everyone is an individual, but is this a common trait of ISTPs? The original topic was living in an RV and traveling full time for awhile, would that be appealing to you?"
Kasilyn13,ENFP,"It keeps trying to tell me that there's self employment tax, but there isn't on spiffs. I can't get to the correct schedule via the questions they're asking"

steel007,INFJ,"You have the words in your mind that you want to write. But while writing, do you skip words by mistake? I don't find these mistakes as I write, most of the time I think."
steel007,INFJ,"Hello ESTPs, 

I'm trying to understand how Se inf is different from Se dom.

Coming to the question, when youre taking in the view(situation where you're trying to find one thing out of 100 things) does it feel like you're looking at/processing one small part of the picture at a time? Like needing many sweeps to find one thing out of the clutter. 

Or are you good at looking at/processing a big chunk of the image at a time?

Essentially, I'm talking about your field of view. I'm not talking about field of view in medical terms. I think this is a bit of weird question maybe. Thanks for taking the time. Much appreciated :)"
steel007,INFJ,"I am trying to understand how reliable my understanding about Perceiving and Judging is. Or how they manifest in terms of Se. Like if it is influenced more by P/J? or is it about Se? Which one of these controls the frequency and need for action more? Or do you think ability/inability to sit idly has nothing to do with P/J?

In my case, I can't sit idly. Always have to be doing something, productive or otherwise. I'd love to hear thoughts of you guys. Thank you very much :D"
steel007,INFJ,"Curious to know what you guys think about this topic. I heard about and thought about things like collective consciousness, there is another theory which I saw in kurtgesagts(a famous YouTube channel) video that we might be all just only one being born again and again as every organism throughout the time(video is called story of an egg, I think). Also the simulation theory... Curious to know what your thoughts about these things are. 

Thank you :)"
steel007,INFJ,"I am sure most of you are familiar with the spammer by now, that keeps on flooding the subs with polls of fictional character typing, burying the useful posts

Instead of reporting them(keeps coming back with new acc), if you just vote the first option in the poll, that would surely render it all pointless for them. You can check their post history to confirm. 

Feel free share the post or make a post of your own for your type's sub if you like the idea. Thanks. Have a nice day :)"
steel007,INFJ,"I have been seeing a lot of posts where people struggle to value themselves and put their needs above others. How to not fall into traps where you may get taken advantage of... When to say no... I have made this up. It might be a bit crude, so feel to free to refine it or add onto it yourself as you see fit. So here it goes :

As long as you don't owe them, when they ask you for help, or even when you feel the need to help unasked, ask yourself these, 
* Will they appreciate your contribution like you expect them to? 
* Will they reciprocate for you? 
* Do they require your help because there is no else? 
* What are you sacrificing while helping them? 
* Is it worth your sacrifice? 

If the answer to even one of these is no, then turn that attention and care you were gonna give them onto yourself. And use that desire to develop yourself in someway. Take care of yourself.

If you can't find a reason to care for yourself, or you think you don't deserve it, then it's seriously time to rethink everything. Until then, no matter how much you do for others or whatever you think will fill the gap, you will always be disappointed and depressed in the end. You're valuable, figure out why."
steel007,INFJ,"It seems like I go through cycles, of complete diving in to whatever my plans are. Focused(when I muster up a lot of motivation), followed by recharging or periods of not feeling motivated to do things. It's like bursts. Is it the like this for you guys as well? Is there a way to reduce downtime? Or ways to get a better pattern? Or is this already the best way for long term productivity?"
whalesdiego,ESTP,"I feel like I've got a pretty well developed Se, Ti, and Fe and i can get along with those pretty well. Ni on the other hand, is a right bword that i have a strong love/hate relationship with. I feel like i can take advantage of the insights and all that, but outside of that, i don't feel like i have any sense if purpose and can't really imagine anything more than a week or so in the future which, as you can probably imagine, makes it very difficult to act NOW. I have a strong intuition in that I'll ""just know things"" and I'm usually right, but it currently exists just to serve the other functions, and I'd like to find a healthy way i can plan for the future and find a sense of purpose because as it stands, I'm basically a great racehorse with no rider.

I'm not sure what I'm looking for. Maybe some ways from high Ni users to develop Ni? Or make it a little healthier?  Mine tends to be very negative and pessimistic which strongly contradicts the rest of my personality but manage to override it often."

ESTP here, married to a very handsome and fun ENTP whom i love very much. Just lookin for some ideas (preferably from ENTPs who are also in successful long term relationships) on how to keep a relationship fun and interesting!

whalesdiego,ESTP,"I'm just curious to see if there are any correlations between the typical dreams a person has and their type! Not asking about specific dreams, just looking for a high level overview of how your dreams typically present. I'll start:

I'm Se-Ti, my dreams are often visually very vivid and colorful, i can even read things in my dreams, remembering letters and all, the visual detail is super sharp and specific. I have never had a recurring dream and sometimes my dreams will have continuous plots over months to years. I don't feel much emotion in my dreams and probably a quarter of them include some kind of high intensity situation (like being attacked by Velociraptors in a parking garage haha actual dream i had) that i have to either save people from or escape from myself but i don't feel any fear. I think I've only ever had one nightmare in my life. I have on a couple occasions had deep, highly meaningful dreams, but they're mostly action oriented or exploratory."

Yujir0Hanma,ESTP,"Sup cousins. I made this post on the r/ESTP subreddit but of course I gotta know how it applies to the 2nd best user of Se ;)

Recently when high af I sat down and realized my reflexes are fairly good. Like def above average. Some situations that stick out:

1. Was washing dishes when a thick heavy plastic cup fell off the counter due to me swinging hard with my arms. Managed to stick my foot out quickly and kicked it back up into the air as if it was a soccer ball before catching it 

2. In high school I turned all the way around in my seat to face someone but in doing so I knocked their flask of water off their desk by accident. In 1 swoop motion the arm that knocked it off spun counter clockwise and I caught it before it could hit the ground 

3. I like to play fight a lot and occasionally brothers mom or someone will throw out some kind of shot at me, a kick, a punch, anything when I least expect it. I always manage to catch their limbs or block them with ease and no struggle, it always sends me into a laughing fit as they can't touch me no matter what they do

4. I woke up annoyed at my alarm clock and sent it flying due to trying to turn it off. I managed to catch the cord and yanked it back to me before it went out of my reach and slammed into my wall, it def would have been busted if I wasn't able to react quickly.

That's just a few instances that immediately come to mind. I know I can't be the only one here with this ability, share your stories below!"

Yujir0Hanma,ESTP,"I'm making my rounds on the subs posting each of the specific types as every single ennegram type. All info is from funky mbti in fiction. Put yours in comments;

ESFP Enneagram 1- detail-oriented, hard-working, and finishes tasks quickly, but will have super strong Fi-ideas of morality, self-control, and the “proper” way to behave which will both frown on others who do not share their values, and prevent them from higher Se indulgences (for example: due to cultural influences, may not believe in, or participate in, premarital sex). May at times feel “hindered” by their strong values.

ESFP Enneagram 2- is much more of a “doer” than an “emotional talker,” often taking direct Te-actions to organize events and problem-solve, rather than truly listening to others’ needs; may give impractical and/or generous gifts out of a desire to help, but a lack of social appropriateness or imagining how the other person might feel. May be distressed that they cannot connect to others as easily as the SFJ-2’s can.

ESFP Enneagram 3- focused on momentary success and pleasures, and prone to Se/Te looping to get it (leaping on success in the short term, in whatever way they think will earn the most attention), which means under-development of aux-Fi (which may also cause problems with Fi’s desire to be truthful / authentic and 3’s desire to impress). Se-dom + 3 results in an extreme focus on sensory impact, which means this type is ruthless about others’ physical appearances and their own overall sensory presentation; may fail, with inferior Ni, to consider the consequences of being insincere or lying to impress others.

ESFP Enneagram 4- will express a dramatic sense of self through fashion and/or sensory hobbies and pursuits, with Fi working with 4 to exaggerate a sense of uniqueness / being true to oneself; due to extroversion, wants to be noticed and appreciated but also feels different from other people, and may drive them away with intense emotional outbursts (Te being prone to bluntness). Good at finishing their creative projects (tert Te) but may be more idealistic with inferior Ni than is usual for ESFPs.

ESFP Enneagram 5- hyper aware of the environment and eager to learn useful skills, but deeply secretive about their intense internal emotions, and will take longer to process them away from others; may deliberately delay dealing with them by looping into Te, which they build up so as to feel competent and safe in the external world; more fearful of the ‘potential’ outcome of their decisions (inferior Ni).

ESFP Enneagram 6- more covetous of traditionalism and rigid ideology than other ESFPs, prone to knee-jerk reactive (and often competent) impulses; less emotional and more driven to arm oneself with Te facts / logic / strong decision making, but struggles with continual self doubt, waffles on decisions once made, and feels insecure about going out on a limb alone; may cling to an ideology of the future that makes them feel safe (Ni).

ESFP Enneagram 7- may mistype as a Ne-dom due to their scattered thought process and constant barrage of ideas; prone to thinking more about the future than other ESFPs (with great excitement and impatience); detachment from other people’s pain and problems, and insensitive in trying to ‘cheer them up’ rather than just listen; habitual abandoner or anything and everything that loses their interest, with an adventurous, wandering spirit. Frequent inferior Ni issues (idealism) and conflict with Se-dom reality.

ESFP Enneagram 8- develops a strong tert-Te in order to achieve things in the outside world, is often confident, self-assertive, and prone to easy boredom; likes to seek out constant challenges at work / school / their personal life, and may create drama where there is none to self-entertain; values a few people very much (especially if they identify with them through Fi) and will champion them with total conviction. Quick to react, may dislike or hide their own emotions / suppress them, or learn to loop to avoid them, and often out of touch with the long-term consequences of their blow-up.

ESFP Enneagram 9- would entirely tune in to other people, in order to read them (using their facial expressions, body language, etc) and put on an amiable, agreeable, good-natured front; the 9 lack of desire to pressure others to conform would fit in naturally with Fi, but Se’s influence might make them more assertive in standing up for others; low Te issues would cause them to postpone decision making and not know what tasks to prioritize in what order."
Yujir0Hanma,ESTP,"Hello you absolute marshmallows! I was requested to do this for you guys as I've done for ESTP and ISTP so here you go, all info taken from funky mbti in fiction. Read, learn a bit, and put your type in the comments;

INFP Enneagram 1- super strong moral judgments which dictate all their decisions; their desire to be hard-working and efficient will tax their inferior Te, making them prone to self-berating for lack of organizational skill or efficiency; prone to unrealistic personal standards of perfection which are vague, and reverts to negative self-comparison to stereotypes (Si), more meticulous due to low Si and harder on themselves than on anyone else.

INFP Enneagram 2- the quiet, sensitive helper who thrives on others’ loves and gives it selflessly in return, but who ‘introverts’ their feelings and needs, vanishes in troubled times in their own life, and feels a sense of loss when they cannot find their place in the world.

INFP Enneagram 3- more outward-focused than other FiNe types, but focused on intuiting what will impress others and/or on achieving personal goals, based on former experiences (something they saw another person do, which impressed them, and they want to emulate through similar achievement – Fi/Si + 3); puts a lot of strain on inferior Te to out-perform the competition and perform well, sometimes exhausting oneself in the process (may fall into 9-ish qualities in-between bouts of extreme hyper-focus and energy), but also struggles with indecision and self-doubt (Ne) while falling prey to Fi/Si loops about past mistakes or failures (and fearing they cannot perform well in the future).

INFP Enneagram 4- melodramatic, easily insulted, and highly individual, the 4 enhances all the natural traits of the INFP to hyper-levels: intense, melodramatic emotions (and more openness in expressing them than other INFPs), high levels of creativity (and extreme sensitivity toward criticism of their hobbies, crafts, writing, costuming, taste in books, etc), a tendency to wax melancholic about the past and fixate on former mistakes, and idealize (while inferior Te struggles to keep momentum going in any project that does not ‘emotionally resonate’ with Fi).

INFP Enneagram 5- super secretive loners who are more analytical, less emotional, more detached, and more interested in impersonal knowledge, which will help them feel safe in the external world; determined to be self reliant, awkward with emotions, and sometimes ‘blocked’ from the true intensity of their feelings; feels ‘detached from the world’ and takes an interest in many different things, to compensate for it (Ne/Si).

INFP Enneagram 6- less emotional and more reliant on logic than other INFPs, quick to read beneath the surface and assign motives to authority figures, or point out flaws in proposed ideas; often indecisive, self-doubting, and distrustful of their Ne (they may not feel it is ‘practical’ in the real world); strong Si-roots (areas in their thought process they refuse to question, challenge, or second-guess); may distrust their logic center, and feel safer when others agree with them. Prone to disappearing when anxious.

INFP Enneagram 7- opportunistic, funny, and always on the move, may come across as an extrovert and mistype as a Ne-dom due to their insatiable need for newness and constant forward motion; different from other INFPs in that they are less ‘serious’ and able to focus on the ‘dark things in life’; may live in a fantasy world rather than face reality.

INFP Enneagram 8- a defensive INFP who fights authority figures at every turn and battles their own indecisive nature, seeing their tendency to want to change their mind as weakness in themselves; has way more energy than is usual for the INFP type, and may not know when to slow down, prone to falling into inferior Te a lot in an attempt to prove themselves strong (but more often, inferior Te comes into play in harsh criticisms of general incompetency

INFP Enneagram 9- will be the most conflict-avoiding of all the types, and struggle with reconciling their desire to be true to themselves (Fi) with their desire to keep others happy, so as to maintain their inner peace. May become settled in their ways / habits and not move forward for decades on end, while channeling their Ne toward new concepts / ideas / possibilities rather than external motion."
Yujir0Hanma,ESTP,"Sup. Title. Need I say more? Did the same thing for my ESTP brethren so imma do the same for my ISTP cousins. All info comes from funkymbti in fiction, read and learn a little bit more about yourself, say your type below;

ISTP Enneagram 1- hard-working, cautious, and attentive to details, more able to reconcile logical reasons not to over-indulge Se, but will feel angrier about self-denial / internal dissatisfaction at stifling their natural Se urges; will often have an abstract ideal of perfection they strive to live up to (tert Ni) and deep shame and/or self-reproach for “allowing their emotions to get away from them” if and when they have inferior Fe meltdowns.

ISTP Enneagram 2- a softer inferior Fe, but one still out of touch with how to soften criticisms in order to find acceptance; may repress their advice and/or draw into themselves, to avoid creating conflict, but also can read people (tert Ni) and feels a need to forewarn them of impending troubles.

ISTP Enneagram 3- an effective and flashy problem solver, more prone to consideration toward the long-term benefits of certain decisions (or consequences of actions) but totally unable to access or deal with their feelings (especially negative ones) in healthy or productive ways; like all the Se types, image-conscious and sensory-pleasure-driven (pursuit of ‘impressive’ toys that scream to the world ‘I am successful’).

ISTP Enneagram 4- a more creative, melancholic, and emotional ISTP, usually more interested in creative pursuits (art, music, dance, etc) than in mechanics or computers, sensitive about their performance, and somewhat proud of being different from their peers. Less hurt by criticism, more inclined to outbursts.

ISTP Enneagram 5- strong desire for independence and isolation, pushes away from others and may forgo human relationships on a deeper level, out of 5 and inferior Fe discomfort with intense emotions in oneself and others; has less emotional outbursts than other Enneagram ISTPs, and more trouble understanding what motivates their feelings; much less ‘hands on’ in trying new things.

ISTP Enneagram 6- intensely analytical, with frequent Ti/Ni loops (predicting the worst and preparing for it), not inclined to risk-taking, low NiFe desire to connect to a larger ideology or group who can provide security in being “right”; especially good at pointing out logical fallacies, and trusting of their ability to ‘read into’ authority figures’ motives.

ISTP Enneagram 7- more of an entertainer than other ISTPs, more adventurous and idealistic, and more in touch with how to cheer others up with their inferior Fe but also out of touch with their feelings. Often a globe-trotter who does not stick with people or negative situations long. May mistype as a Ne-using type due to 7’s similarities with Ne descriptions. Prone to Ti/Ni loops.

ISTP Enneagram 8- inferior Fe would make this ISTP even more out of touch with how people perceive them and how to soften the blow than other ISTP Enneagram combinations; they would see no reason for social appropriateness and instead, channel their intense energy into external projects. Often sharp-tongued and unable or unwilling to let faulty thinking go unchallenged. Has absolute faith in their Ti/Ni insights, may run the risk of a lack of nuance or in understanding emotional motivators, and have little respect for irrational or sensitive people.

ISTP Enneagram 9- would develop a system of rational sharing and/or dealing with others that avoids conflict as much as possible, would often shut up about their logical complaints / be aware this could cause friction, might be prone to “laziness” / over-indulgences, or channeling their Se into video gaming instead of showing ambition in the work force, while also stressing about keeping their loved ones happy (lower Fe)."
Yujir0Hanma,ESTP,"ESTP Enneagram 1- detail-oriented, hard-working, and will not allow themselves to leap on opportunities that seem somehow immoral and/or irresponsible; often struggles to contain and control Se-dom desires, may secretly feel “sinful” for having Se-based impulses and thoughts; with no outlet for their anger, they may erupt in low Fe ways (through violence) for which they will then feel ashamed and seek external affirmation / reassurances.

ESTP Enneagram 2- an amiable problem-solver, skilled in reading people and responding in the moment to their needs, often with high tert-Fe development, which softens the ESTP’s usual blunt methods into greater social awareness and a desire to help rather than criticize.

ESTP Enneagram 3- the ultimate smooth-talking successful businessman type; a natural charmer and performer, who uses tert-Fe to woo people but often does not know what is real (the persona) and what is not (his/her true self); Se-dom + 3 results in an extreme focus on sensory impact, which means this type is ruthless about others’ physical appearances and their own overall sensory presentation; often good at reading subtle signs in other people, and may deviate from already nebulous morals to ‘achieve’ or ‘get ahead.’ May fail, with inferior Ni, to consider the consequences of being insincere or lying to impress others.

ESTP Enneagram 4- May seek out expensive or bold items designed to make them stand out, prone to Se/Fe loops and intense feelings not entirely understood by the ESTP (since they tend to analyze emotion and struggle to understand or feel comfortable with it); it may cause them to see no real need to improve Fe, since doing so would make them too ‘common’ but also have frequent emotional outbursts and tantrums. Prone to flattery and charm, then abandonment of people whenever their fears of intimacy arise.

 ESTP Enneagram 5- stronger access to aux-Ti analytical abilities, without the usual emphasis on ‘living high and loose’; more introverted / easily drained, less inclined to take charge; may loop into Fe, and not know how to handle it, but fail to entirely subdue their emotions and wind up frustrated; more fearful of the ‘potential’ outcome of their decisions (inferior Ni).

ESTP Enneagram 6- far more risk-adverse and more analytical than other ESTPs, may mistype as an ISTP due to reliance on Ti, with inferior Ni struggling to identify future negative outcomes; prone to a lot of negativity about the future (and singular conclusions about it); less self-assured about their ability to wing things, prone to low-level anxiety over tert-Fe (the desire to connect to others, but uncertainty and suspicion causing detachment issues).

ESTP Enneagram 7- can mistype as a Ne-dom due to their scattered thought process and constant barrage of ideas; prone to thinking more about the future than other ESTPs (with great excitement and impatience). Uses Se/Fe + 7 to be hilarious and entertain others, but detached from their own feelings; may really have a hard time separating brutal reality (what Se sees) from what 7 does not want to deal with, causing frequent Ni-grips.

ESTP Enneagram 8 (🐐🐐🐐)- an aggressive, physically imposing, confrontational, argumentative combination, who does not believe in backing away from a fight, literal or figurative, whose lower Ni development helps him/her spot people who are weak or incompetent; prone to not mincing words, challenging authority figures, and often undertakes leadership to appease the public’s general welfare (tert-Fe, which can often make the ESTP-8 “charming” and offset the tough edge).

ESTP Enneagram 9- would be far less risk-adverse, more prone to inertia, more in touch with their tert-Fe (at least, in the sense of knowing how to establish and maintain superficial connections to others, to avoid conflict; but even less in touch with their own feelings), less blunt, and more considerate of future implications (low Ni wanting to “get it right” + 9’s hesitance in anything new that disrupts their peace of mind) than other ESTPs.

Khajiit_Has_Upvotes,ESTP,"Messing around with SpeedTreeCAD to see what I can and can't get into the game.

Fronds--does anybody know *why* this doesn't work?

Seeds--vanilla trees have several different seeds assigned in the CS, but it will always only use the first one in the list. Anybody know why? Is there a fix?"
Khajiit_Has_Upvotes,ESTP,"Hey guys, I see on the [petco.com](https://petco.com) website that they will price match online orders to amazon, chewy, walmart, etc:

>Petco.com Price Match Policy  
>  
>Petco.com will match regular and sale prices found at Petco and Unleashed by Petco stores. We do match prices available to the general public (i.e. not any special prices available to members of subscription or membership programs) at the following select online retailers (amazon.com, chewy.com, jet.com, petsmart.com, walmart.com, wag.com, target.com). We do not match prices at other retailers that are not previously listed.

>**Q: Does Petco.com match the prices of Internet or other non-store retailers?**A: We do match prices at the following select online retailers (amazon.com, chewy.com, jet.com, petsmart.com, walmart.com, wag.com, target.com). We do not match prices at other retailers that are not previously listed.

I don't see any way at or before checkout to actually get this price match, though. Does anybody know how to do this? Can I price match orders that I pick up in-store? My local stores absolutely, 100% will not price match anything but [Petco.com](https://Petco.com), and have told me online retailers are only price matched with online orders. None of them know how to do it, though."
Khajiit_Has_Upvotes,ESTP,"I'm looking at the online order form because somebody down the road from me just got it (still don't know if he's just a late beta invite or what lol). It's $499 for the hardware, $99/mo for the service, some shipping and taxes. It says ""due today $99"". Does anybody know if the rest is just rolled into the monthly payment? Or will they notify me my order is ready to ship and expect the $499+shipping+taxes at that point? How does this work?"

Khajiit_Has_Upvotes,ESTP,"Just wanted to give an update on my daughter's [injured betta](https://www.reddit.com/r/bettafish/comments/hl9azi/injured_betta_details_in_comments/). I haven't been able to get online much (my internet has been down more than it's been up the past several days) but just wanted to say that I've followed u/notherworldentirely's advice as best I can and he's healing nicely. None of my local fish/pet stores carry Stressguard and online ordering was at least a week out for delivery so I had to make due with API StressCoat (I know it doesn't do everything Stressguard does), added tannins to the water, have been doing daily water changes, etc. I'd post an updated picture but he doesn't like my phone, I only got a picture of his injuries because he was too messed up at that time to dart away.

He's up to his normal shenanigans, has been eating just fine since the day after the incident, and the last few days he's been swimming around the tank like nothing happened. Thanks for the help, guys!"
Khajiit_Has_Upvotes,ESTP,"Hey guys I hope this his the right place to ask. I have an old Coleman EB15B electric furnace and the blower fails intermittently. We're in the pacific northwest just south of the Canada border, and it's pretty nippy outside. Having a strange issue with the blower.

When the thermostat is set below \~76F the blower intermittently fails to kick on. The element works just fine. It gets nice and toasty, but the blower frequently will not kick on. When the thermostat is set to \~76F or higher it seems to work perfectly.

So element works just like it's supposed to. Blower only works when the thermostat is set to ""literal hell"". Is this just a bad thermostat? Is there anything else I should look at as well?"
Khajiit_Has_Upvotes,ESTP,"Hope it's okay to ask this. I'm playing swtor and thinking about recording the class stories. Can anybody recommend video editing software? I just need to be able to trim video clips, stitch them together, and add some simple scene transitions. In the past I used windows movie maker but it was so buggy that I gave up."
Khajiit_Has_Upvotes,ESTP,"Just curious how other ESTP's might handle a situation where, after cooling down a bit, you realize you're the asshole.

This morning I got into a tiff with my neighbor, and by tiff I mean I wound up cussing him out and telling him to stay off my fucking property (I live on rural acreage). Went home, calmed down a little, thought about it, and went over and apologized to him, told him that I was out of line, he didn't deserve that, and I was being unfair (because I was).

How direct or indirect are you guys with conflict resolution?"
goldenlikedaylight9,ESTP,I'm either an 8w7 or 3w2 I can't figure it out
goldenlikedaylight9,ESTP,"For me it's the roller coaster one. I get so scared before (and during) a roller coaster. Ofc I would never admit that irl. I'm perfectly fine doing other thrill seeking type things, it's just something about roller coasters that are scary"
goldenlikedaylight9,ESTP,What songs would y'all put in a playlist for estps?
goldenlikedaylight9,ESTP,"I'm curious. For me, probably fake people or when someone's trying to tell me what to do. Another big one is when someone tells me I'm one way when I'm not. So, what sets you off?"
lawlietackerman,ESTP,"alright so I've recently been really confused between two mbti types, I can't seem to figure out if I'm an entj or an estp. If there's anyone that's experienced in typing, and would be willing to help type me personally then do let me know, thank you so much."
lawlietackerman,ESTP,"alright so long story short, me and my enfp friend went to an interview for an internship and were told we'd get a call a week later confirming our acceptance, a week passes by, and my enfp friend gets the call and I don't, now I'm planning on calling them myself tomorrow morning to ask if I'm accepted or not so that I can go forward with my plans, but surprisingly I feel like shit over the events. Why'd she get the call and I didn't? my interview went well and I'm great with this type of stuff, she honestly isn't the best with it and her interview didn't go too well either. I'm sort of conflicted internally, because I feel like a shit person for thinking like that about my best friend, while at the same time I'm angry with myself, how dare I not be competent enough to get accepted? I'm supposed to be good at, well, everything, so why didn't I get the call? ngl this is sort of harming whatever image I have of myself and it's triggering some really negative feelings that I don't know how to deal with and don't want to deal with. I've already found a solution, that I'll give them a call myself, but whAt do I do about the mf emotions. What do you people recommend, what would you do? and how do I heal my hurt ego lmao."
lawlietackerman,ESTP,"contented-ness > happiness. Happiness is an emotion and therefore just like any other emotion, it is not constant, there are ups and downs and happiness just depends on those factors, it comes and goes. Thankfully, I recently have begun to feel more content with life and myself, and some would say it's not a good method, but I've done it through ignoring Stuff and living life on the edge. A lot of the times, the more you think, the 'unhappier' you'll be, what I mean by thinking is overthinking, thinking yourself into a pit of depression and yes it's real. Therefore keep yourself busy, be so involved in the moment that you don't give yourself any time to think. Start noticing the little moments, the laughs, the smiles, the time you spent with your loved ones and doing stuff you like. Start looking at life for the positive things than the negative ones, and trust me there are a shit ton of negative things to look for. Change your perception and you'll change everything. Live for yourself, this is hard asf lmao and I still can't do it (I'm an entj 3 smh what do I expect) but for the most part I've succeeded. Also, talk to people when you're suffering, let it out and don't let it build up inside you, as a human you can only bear so much. Hope things get better for you :))"
lawlietackerman,ESTP,"a question, which functions or mbti types would you people think require examples to be able to understand a situation or scenario completely and entirely?"
