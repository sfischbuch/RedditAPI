Springbeam,ENFP,Hello ENFPs! Anyone have a good link to find which enneagram test is most accurate?
Springbeam,ENFP,"Fellow ENFPs, I am extremely curious-

I find that I am very disconnected from death or injured animals, that I don't get emotionally attached to them, and so am easily able to euthanize or detach myself from a situation in which an animal is passing away. Does anyone relate? Any idea why?  


I think possibly it could be to do with a very scientific outlook on everything, finding death more fascinating than a sad emotional occasion. I'd love to hear your thoughts."
Springbeam,ENFP,Alohaaaaa. Does anyone know the Requirements for a 5th prestigeeee? <3
Springbeam,ENFP,"I don't know about you guys, but I loved the royale mode. Why did it get taken away? Would people like it back?"
eNiMaLx,INTJ,I just bought a 2014 GX 2WD 6MT with 60k mi and for some unknown reason from 2nd to 3rd gear the engine rpm slows down VERY slowly. It takes like 5 s for it to come down from 2500 to 2000 rpm with the clutch fully in. It slows down normally in other gears. Thoughts?
eNiMaLx,INTJ,"**Disclaimer:**

I initially posted this in r/motorcycles but did not get the appreciation I expected. I am pre-emptively deleting it over there and am re-posting it where it properly belongs. No other disclaimer.

**Chapter 1: Foundation**

If you want to live long as a squid, you must have the skill to back it up. No way around it. Think about it. What happens if you encounter traffic at an intersection from both the left and right sides both wrongly going across the intersection? If you accelerate too slowly to overtake while riding on the opposite traffic lane? If opposite traffic suddenly appears out of nowhere while you are overtaking a car before a small hill you thought was clear of traffic? If you blow through a stop sign into 45 mph traffic? If you underestimate how tight the upcoming corner is? If you accelerate too hard into a corner by mistake? If you encounter sand while turning at a stop sign? If you downright miss a corner and end up on the opposite traffic lane with sand everywhere on the ground and 35 mph incoming traffic? If you go too fast into a corner with a big dip in it? If you encounter a fallen tree on the road? If you encounter a baby bear running into you? I have done all those and I only crashed once (the very first one). All the other ones I have avoided through my braking, throttle, swerving, cornering, visual or a combination of those skills. If I hadn't practiced emergency braking, my R1 would've ended up in a ditch across the road when I blew way past the stop sign and didn't get hit by side traffic by pure luck. More recently, I would've hit that baby bear and possibly gotten eaten by an angry mama bear if the R1 broke down after hitting the baby bear. Squidding is serious business. If you can't brake from 25 mph in under 18 feet, trail brake, have the throttle finesse to smoothly accelerate in first gear both in a straight line and out of corners, swerve and corner on a dime, feel the tires' grip through your hands, and judge corner speed and identify danger with your eyes, DO NOT BE A SQUID! You WILL die if you greatly overestimate a corner's speed or greatly underestimate dangerous things like sand, gravel and bumps in corners or traffic of any kind. For a squid survival is the name of the game. To survive, you must have a solid foundation. If you purely rely on luck, you will die.

**Chapter 2: Gear and suspension**

Riding on a two-wheel steel machine is already dangerous enough as it is, add squidding and you have a highly potential recipe for disaster. I learned just how important gear is after I low-sided from 25 mph in Vietnam and received a stitch below my left elbow and multiple bruises. I was fortunate to learn it from such a minor crash. Countless other squids have not been as lucky. Every time you double your speed, you quadruple the kinetic energy you carry with you. At 50 mph that small stitching may have instead been a bone fracture, or worse, a ground down bone. My hands and feet could also have been degloved and trust me you don't want that to happen to you. Even with a solid foundation, you can never completely eliminate the risk of crashing. Road surfaces aren't static, you never know whether the upcoming corner has a diesel spill, which by the way looks just like a wet road, or anything of the sort. Don't be that squid going at 150 mph wearing a t-shirt and shorts.

It is also primordial that you sort out the bike's suspension before doing any squidding. A well set up suspension will be the most stable while accelerating, braking and cornering. Have the wrong setup and encounter a dip or bump at dangerous speeds and you may die. First thing to set up is preload. Measure your suspension's range while it's fully extended. Now sit on it, bounce the suspension a few times then measure how much it lowered. You want 25 to 35 mm of sag both in the front and rear. Second thing to set up is rebound damping. Go ride a minimum of 30 mins then bounce each the front and the rear and watch the rebound. You want both to rebound like bike number 5 in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1r10TcUpaw). Then test for congruity by bouncing the gas tank and the seat. Both front and rear must rise and stop at the same rate. The brake lines in the front are a good place to look at. Third thing to set up is the compression. The ideal compression setting is the one that leaves the front with 10-20 mm of travel left and the rear with 5-8 mm of travel left off the top of the rubber bumper (eyeball it from looking at the clean vs dirty part) after a spirited ride. For the front use the fully extended fork measurement and subtract from it the owner's manual fork travel measurement to know where the bottom out is. With the perfect compression settings, the front and rear should feel like they're compressing at the same time after a bump.

**Chapter 3: Progression and limit**

Just like you don't run from the get-go without walking first, you don't go blasting at 150 mph your first time on a liter sport bike. Everything must be done in baby steps. The more gradual, the better. Also never exceed 7/10th of your skill. You're not at a track where you can go 10/10th with minimal consequences. You need that 3/10th as your safety margin. If you also have sport touring tires like me, I don't recommend you drag knees. Dragging knee will pretty much be your safety margin to get out of trouble. With stickier tires you have more margin so you can go faster, and brake deeper and lean more in corners, but remember to never exceed 7/10th of your skill. If you must drag knee/elbow, do it at the very end of corners, never through the whole corner. When I narrowly avoided that baby bear I was 3 ft away from hitting it. In retrospect I should've gone a little slower in that medium-width forest section. If you imagine a baby bear suddenly running across the road, could you brake and/or swerve to avoid it? If you can't, slow down! Also always leave yourself a braking margin by slowing down to the corner speed well before the corner. For 125 mph I leave myself 1000 ft.

To progress, first try maxing out your first gear at 25% throttle. Still feeling okay? Next do it at 35% throttle and so on and so forth. Once you master first gear, time to master second, then third (then fourth, fifth and sixth if you find a long enough stretch of road without cops or traffic and with 3000+ ft of visibility). After each time practice extending your upper body like a sail for the air brake effect and more importantly get a feel for it. It is very potent at 125+ mph and you will need it to not overheat your stock brakes.

At your favorite twisties do a run in 6th gear. If you feel fine, do it next in 5th gear, and so on. Throughout the exercise also get a feel for the throttle. Experiment with the percentage and speed of the throttle at the corner exits.

The fastest and safest way around a corner on a supersport bike is the squaring off method, aka late apex. Don't accelerate throughout the corner unless you're testing and getting a feel for your cornering speed. It's not safe as it can make you run wide. It's also slower.

**Chapter 4: Avoiding trouble**

Line of sight-blocking things such as trees, consecutive corners and hills are your friends. Huge elevation changes à la Mulholland that let cops gun you down with their radar gun from above, villages/towns/cities and very long flat straights are your enemy.

Be fluid like water. Squid away when the opportunity comes and change back to an exemplary rider when the opportunity is gone.

Check for cops everywhere you go (including behind you). Also, if you see regular-looking parked cars, DON'T squid. Unmarked cop cars are very common. Don't see anything? Squid away.

You will have to refer to another guide to escape trouble. I don't like the idea of attracting the attention of cops to begin with so I will only squid when it's clear to do so. My idea of fun is not getting chased down by cops with murderous intents. Yours may be different from mine, but that also means the risk of going to jail should your bike's engine suddenly blow up *à la S1000RR*...

Don't be a stupid squid. Be a smart squid. ✌️"

giraffarigboo,INTJ,"Hello INFPs. My brother is very much an INFP. I was reading up about your type because I've been reading about my entire family, and in an article about INFPs there was a section talking about how INFPs can often struggle in ""normal"" jobs because they want to do something they feel morally good about. As an INTJ with a pretty strong Fi function, I definitely agree. However for my brother, it has gotten to a point of career paralysis. He keeps trying new jobs and just canNOT. He really wants to be a writer, and just wants a job for the moment to support himself at the bare minimum so he has time to write. Has anyone had a similar obstacle in finding steady work, and if so, how did you overcome it?"
giraffarigboo,INTJ,"I’m pretty new to studying the cognitive functions so this could be way off base. But every time I see someone type a typical detective character on the internet, they type them as an XNXX. I feel like this is actually the intuitive bias in the MBTI community causing us to assume that every intelligent character is intuitive. 

There are two particular TV detectives that I think are actually Se users, and these are Sherlock Holmes as portrayed by Benedict Cumberbatch in Sherlock and Shawn Spencer from Psych. The majority of the internet seems to think Sherlock is INTP and Shawn is ENTP. 

In both shows, whenever the detective stumbles upon a crime scene, the camera pans to all these small details they notice that most people would never catch and then they take all these sensory details and put them together to come up with what happened. They are able to pinpoint precisely which details help them come to that conclusion. This slightly falls apart when they then use these details to predict where the perpetrator will be in the future, but that could just be Ti. This is not the future-oriented innovation of Ne. That said I haven’t seen either of these shows in a long time and I do recall Sherlock coming up with some new forensic techniques which I could see an INTP doing but idk. 

Basically I think it’s plausible that Sherlock is an ISTP (which I think a lot of people agree are some of the most “intuitive” sensors) and Shawn is an ESTP. 

Does anyone have any thoughts? I’d love to see what people would say on the flip side so I can get a better understanding of the functions. 

I mainly used this article and some descriptions of Ne and Se on this subreddit to come up with this theory.

giraffarigboo,INTJ,"I’ve searched past posts and there hasn’t been an in depth discussion on this in a few years. 

I’m a woman in engineering school, and hoping to get an internship in the next couple of semesters. I was wondering what people have to say about current gender relations? I can find the statistics about what percentage of each field are women online and I have no problem being primarily around men, but I’m wondering if there’s any difference in treatment by management and coworkers. I know that a lot of people resent women in certain fields due to the possibility of only being there due to affirmative action. Has anyone experienced this in ChemE? Are there any particular industries to avoid for this reason? Responses from any genders are welcome."
giraffarigboo,INTJ,My answer along with some analyses of people I commonly play with will be in the comments.
giraffarigboo,INTJ,"Over the past few months, I've noticed something strange on a street I frequently use. The street is in between a train station to the city and a small local airport. Every day on the sidewalk right outside the entrance to the airport, there will be a man wearing a wind breaker jacket with a wagon surrounded by canvas fabric like [this.] (https://www.woodscanada.com/products/woods-outdoor-collapsible-utility-king-wagon-225-lb-capacity-green?variant=31639429120137&currency=USD&utm_medium=product_sync&utm_source=google&utm_content=sag_organic&utm_campaign=sag_organic&gclid=CjwKCAjw47eFBhA9EiwAy8kzNNHeQhaIX_VomBNPyQSHl8Re2FiL8P5jgIjIjnQtbs7hRkyTWzjlWBoCdkQQAvD_BwE)
 
The weird thing about it is that every day it is a different man, or at least, there's enough different men that I can't keep track of them. I can never spot what's in the rolling cart, but it doesn't look like he's selling anything. It wouldn't make sense if he was because pedestrians never use that street and it's not near a light where people stop their car. Every time I drive by one of these guys is there, same jacket, same wagon, different face. Usually he just stands there, but one time I saw him urinating on the street. I also find the wind breaker odd because in my area, temperatures are getting up to 90ºF right now. 

 Does anyone know what's happening or why the men are there? The first time I saw it, I assumed it was a homeless man who rode in from the city using the train, but now it has been going on for months and the fact that it's a different person each time is just baffling."
giraffarigboo,INTJ,"Tl;dr: Physics 1 was not my favorite course. It might've just been a bad prof. Is this a sign I shouldn't do ChemE and I should to Chem instead? 

So I'm between choosing a ChemE degree and a Chemistry degree. I was a math major for a while, but when I started my advanced courses, it was almost all really boring proof writing and not any of the applied problem solving that I loved. I really like Chemistry, Applied math, and CS, so I thought ChemE would be a good choice. I decided to apply to transfer to an engineering school and this semester I took some pre-reqs and other classes that would transfer.

One of the courses I took was physics 1. I thought I'd really like it because I like math and problem solving and the physics parts of calculus. However, I hated it. I'm not sure I hated it because I disliked the course material itself. There were some things I thought were interesting. I once took a physics of music class as an elective, and i thought it was the coolest thing ever. I just had an awful prof and it soured physics for me. 

I was reading online that ChemE is a lot more physics than chemistry and this worried me. I will be taking physics 2 over the summer and I don't need to decide on my transfer until July. Should I just rule out ChemE now and do Chem instead, should I wait and see how physics 2 goes, or does it not really matter that this one class sucked??"

wonder689,INFP,Atypical on Netflix. Watch it. I am sure you will relate and enjoy it. I kept thinking of my sweet introverts ppl while watching it.
wonder689,INFP,"When I was in middle school, a new girl joined our class. She was a shy and silent girl trying to adjust in new class. Now, it is common for us to learn two or more languages in school. English and some other language. 
One time we had to write an essay. Everyone wrote one, including the new girl. She had poor English skills at that time. So the essay was not upto the mark and had many grammatical mistakes. She simply wanted to write about her daily experience traveling to school by bus. But when read out aloud, it sounded weird because of lack of proper punctuation and full stop. The teacher found this essay funny. 
Next day the teacher comes in the classroom, declares what a stupid essay this new girl wrote, insults her openly for her skills and reads out the essay aloud in front of everyone. Since we were not mature enough, most students laughed at her. 
At first I didn't realize the gravity of the situation, and when I saw her face, You could see small teardrops rolling on her cheeks. I was taken aback and utterly speechless. It suddenly dawned on me what just happened. This incident broke her emotionally.
The new girl never returned to class. The last we heard, she transferred to another school.
I never forgot this incident and I still feel sorry for her and i hope she is doing alright."

autumn_em,INTJ,"I wanted to make this post for a time now, and I also saw that some people here have asked previously this question too, but I thought it was important to let some more time to pass in order to get a better picture of the progression of the symptoms. In my country they are asking us in my age range to register now for the vaccine, I am planning on getting the vaccine, but I would like to know what might happen after getting it, since many of the women with pmdd are reporting having a worsening on their pmdd and more negative symptoms. I, personally, have a bad history with progesterone BC, I used to have normal pms before taking progesterone, the first month taking it I got very very bad emotional symptoms and I stopped taking it... but I developed pmdd and for the following months it never ever improved, for some reason, some time later I once again took progesterone BC, and the same happened, my pmdd got even worse that it was already, and again even after stop taking it, the worsening never improved. 

So, since I have experienced what is like to take something and having the reaction of a side effect on my pmdd that never improved, and this is clearly a new treatment that we just don't know the whole picture of how it can impact pmdd, I want to ask of the ones that had the covid vaccine, did you have any side effects that impacted your pmdd?, what symptoms did you have? and how long did the symptoms last?, are you feeling better now? did your pmdd return how it was? are you feeling completely normal now? Thanks."
autumn_em,INTJ,"She is the most intelligent and strong woman I have ever met, I think due to our Te-Te communication, we talk about the facts and we talk in a straightforward and open manner. That is why I think many mbti prejudices can be so unfair, the two most caring, loyal and yes, open minded people I have known are ESTJ. My ESTJ best friend, she listen to my feelings, she is empathetic and shows me great emotional support along side with practical and direct advise. The one thing I could say about some unhealthy ESTJs is anger problems, my ESTJ friend has said to me how she recognizes the anger issue, and she believes that it's a trait that has to be changed and control, because ofc compassion and patience has to come first, so she really really tries, I have seen it, it is admirable. Also, I have found that due to their Te-Ne, ESTJs are very intellectually curious, so they hear me out, and unlike many other types, they do not take it as personal but always admit when they got the facts wrong, cause they like learning, the same as healthy INTJs that don't have a problem with admitting when they are wrong cause we care the most about keep learning. I will admit sometimes when I let my Ni-Te talk, they see me as if I am talking ""weirdly"", but they do actually understand what I am saying, so I can see in their face how their mind starts to process all that I am saying, and they give me a good answer that helps me to keep grounded.

 In my personal opinion, if the ESTJ shares our same values and morals (Fi) and as we also do, puts facts and reason over emotion, ESTJs can understand us INTJs enough and be great friends (as partners idk, never had that experience), and I can't help but to admire their diligence, reliability and hard work."
autumn_em,INTJ,"I am back in college to train in psychotherapy, but today the class is being given by a psychiatrist and just in a very short time, the psychiatrist said:

* anxiety disorders -need to be always treated- with psychiatric pills along side the therapy.
* anxiety disorders are heavily influenced by genetics. (as if there was any conclusive and valid evidence of this).
* psychiatric pills are benign and very safe ""medications"" compared to other medications in other medical fields.
* antidepressants aren't addictive, and patients shouldn't be afraid to take them.
* Talked about the ""chemical imbalance theory"" as if it was true and not already debunked.

A class mate asked the question about ""how much dose of antidepressant could cause bad side effects"", the psychiatrist responded that antidepressants are safe and the person would need to take the whole bottle of pills to have a negative effect. Literally.

I am just speechless at the blatant lies, the teaching of debunked and not evidence based theories that can cause horrible harm. I feel sorry for the patients. I don't think this psychiatrist has bad intentions, but nevertheless there is a duty to question, research and to follow the evidence for the safety of the patients, and this just makes me sad and worried for them, like even psychiatrists admit that the chemical imbalance theory isn't true and know that antidepressants can cause severe and lasting withdrawal symptoms... like this psychiatrist isn't even keeping up to date. How safe could they be if they can cause akathisia and compared to placebo they can induce violent and suicidal behavior, just to mention some side effects. I am aware I have to be careful when to speak up and to ""choose my battles wisely"" I just needed to vent, it feels surreal."
autumn_em,INTJ,"So I wanted to ask ENTPs if you guys would be fine being in a long term relationship with a very introverted person, like with someone that doesn't like to go out that much, that can be perfectly fine with being inside just reading for days, and doesn't like too much social interaction like in big groups, I think being social and having a group of friends as a support system is a very healthy thing, but like as an introvert, too much frequent interaction can feel overwhelming.

I have been on dates with ENTPs in the past, and when they started to feel a crush on me and not longer just a friendship, they started to invite me out like a lot, they already had plans of doing like a party at their house or just some social reunion with their friends and they wanted me to start being a part of those. They had big plans for their future and in my opinion they all sounded like too much energy. Basically being with an ENTP felt like constant too much energy that I didn't feel I could keep up.

So I am curious about you guys perspective, if you feel like you would be able to compromise and be ok in the long term, if your partner can't keep up constantly and needs some time and space. Or someone that can match the energy is really needed."
autumn_em,INTJ,"I wouldn't say I was free of pmdd symptoms this past month, but they were significantly more tolerable. Normally, I struggle with symptoms for a whole week before my period, and this past month I only struggled for three days before my period with a lot of anxiety and depression, the rest of the week prior to my period I would say the symptoms were lighter than normal that at first I didn't even noticed I was in my ""pmdd week"", and day 2 and 3 after my period, I also felt better than I normally do.

What personally helped me was that this past month I took daily both DHA-EPA (300mg algae derived) and a prenatal multivitamin and mineral. I am also vegan, and I wouldn't say having a vegan diet helps pmdd, but maybe it has do to with probably me being deficient in some aspect I wasn't aware of. Regardless, I wanted to share :)"

Pilfercate,INTJ,"If when I'm intoxicated I don't change fundamentally, does that mean people who are assholes or violent when intoxicated are just peeling back the layers to their true self? There's obviously a difference in representation from a few drinks to a dozen, but I'm specifically referring to the point where inhibitions start dissolving. Probably 3-6 strong drinks for most. Other than being social lubricant, do any INTJs here have significant personality swings with alcohol? Maybe it is too difficult for people who live behind a well developed facade to maintain the fake persona in those circumstances. Any theories or insight on the matter?"
Pilfercate,INTJ,"It is my belief that modern society has an issue in accepting an excessive level of disingenuous actions in social situations.

But like idk maybe I just like mom's in general, even young mom's, that like just became a mom recently, there's something about them that homey and family like that just makes me comfy.

Maybe they are just super chill and non judgemental and talkative? Idk I just allways end up being more friendly with them then like all my other friends relationship with other people's mom's. 

Idk, maybe they are like girls so I like talking and chilling with them but there's no attraction to them or me trying to get them or anything, so it's like I'm a girl talking to a girl and it's just super easy and chill.

They sound like reasonable excuses, but I can't help but sense that something's not right. Why wouldn't he have responded or called her back after work? 

Can anyone possibly provide some insight into what's happening?

elvenfangirl,ISFP,"Hello! ISFP writer here! I've got a male INTJ character that is trying to impress a girl and am wondering how you INTJ types flirt.

Not sure if this will help, but here's a little backstory...
He is an assassin working for an agency that wants to bring down the unjust and corrupt monarchies of the world (it's a dystopian world, so they're everywhere). The girl is a princess, the heir to a throne, actually, and she is rather naive. He is doing his best to reel her in and get her to trust him.

Any and all ideas are welcome! Thanks for reading!"

TSE_Jazz,ISFP,"Hi everyone! It’s been probably 12-13 years since I’ve had a lesson and covid has reinvigorated my love for the game, so I’m in need of a lesson (or 10). 

I was wondering if anyone has any pros they would recommend for a lesson or who they’ve had good experiences with.

Thank you!"
