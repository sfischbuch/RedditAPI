TongueTwistingTiger,ENFP,"Hello bookworm friends! I was hoping some of you can make recommendations for books that take place in Mexico City. Indigenous/Mexican authors preferred, of course, however I’m willing to read anything that takes place in the early to mid-nineties (1990 - 1995).

Additionally, if you happen to know any stories that take place in Morocco, please include those as well. 

Novels, non-fiction. You name it. 

I’ve been to Mexico City before, but it’s been years and I was a tourist. I’d love to get a local’s perspective by reading books that take place in the city. Subject matter doesn’t matter. 

I’m hoping to set a novella I’m writing in Mexico City during this time period and I need to... inform my imagination for proper, authentic, and respectful storytelling. 

Thank you in advance."
TongueTwistingTiger,ENFP,"Totally not important post, but ever since I was a kid, I wanted to have a summer birthday. My birthday is in the fall, and I changed schools a lot, so I never really had new friends who were interested enough to come to my party. 

My mom was a swimmer, so we always had a pool in our backyard, and I thought maybe if I had a birthday in the summer, more people would want to come to swim! 

When I discovered that Usagi’s birthday was June 30th, it made my jealousy even stronger. Even now, soooo many years later, I still want a summer birthday. 

BUT! I discovered today that my CAKE DAY is Usagi’s birthday. 

IT’S THE STUPIDEST THING TO BE HAPPY ABOUT! BUT I’M SO HAPPY. 

Anyway, I’ll take it! I’m happy I get to participate in such a special day, however small. 

If today is your birthday, OMG HAPPY BIRTHDAY!!!

Also, no upvotes or anything. Just thought I’d share with those sorting through “New”. I don’t have any friends who love both Reddit AND Sailor Moon. 

P.S. is the new cake icon not the most adorable thing?"

TongueTwistingTiger,ENFP,"So, being an older millennial, a few of my friends have started having kids. No sweat off my back, as these are generally friends I don't see super regularly. Suddenly every few months it's: baby showers, birthdays, BBQs filled with kids. You're constantly expected to bring gifts for children you know absolutely nothing about. Worst of all, you have to watch as your friends (who used to have personalities and identities all their own) turn into absolutely miserable people who only want to complain about their lives/kids

And I'm supposed to be supportive because you did what everyone told you you had to do? I'm supposed to spend money? I'm supposed to drive three hours out of my way to the extended burbs just so that I can speak to you for five minutes in between your spawn screaming at you? No. 

And the complaining once covid started? 

""Oh, my kids can't play outside!"" 

""Oh my god, the kids can't go to school!"" 

""I'm so tired from being with my kids all day."" 

""Ugh! I'm exhausted! my kids are draining the life out of me!"" 

Then guess what? You shouldn't have fucking had them. I've ALWAYS been of the perception that unless you can provide absolutely everything that child needs, you shouldn't have kids. The complete and total lack of ambition these parents have shown in actually educating their own children over the past year is repugnant. 

Read a book with your kid and talk about the metaphors and important aspects within. You can typically get worksheets for English, Math, Elementary Science, and textbooks relating to pretty much every subject. Teaching is hard, but curriculums online are pretty easy to follow, and kids are smarter than their parents give them credit for.

You see, you didn't become a parent; what you did was sign a social contract with the government stipulating that you'll provide them future labour and taxes, so long as the government takes care of their health, education, and play space. The government can decide it's going to pull out of that agreement, like it did last year, forcing parents to understand what kind of terrible little people they've been raising. But that's what you signed up for. 

Losing your identity and being focused on your own family is just par the course. It's just that it's not MY course. I'm not interested in spending time with your kids. I'm friends with YOU. If YOU no longer exist because ""mommy/daddy"" brain has taken over, how am I supposed to relate to you at all? See how that works? 

You made your choice, and look at all the baggage that comes with it. Why on EARTH would your friends who SELECTED to be child free be absolutely under ANY obligation to celebrate your family when you don't have the time for ours? 

TL;DR - People act like their CF friends should happily be along for the ride as they have kids of their own. I think that if you have kids, you should respect the choices of your CF friends to take a step back.  If someone explains that they don't want to be friends with you because they don't enjoy scheduling around children, take it in stride. Our time is just an important too."
TongueTwistingTiger,ENFP,"Guys... as someone who has been obsessed with the neighbourhood since I was in my early twenties (and as someone who studied sequential art in school): these backgrounds are both incredibly realistic and very beautifully done. A lot of the 90’s architecture is there, some stuff that hasn’t been around SINCE the 90’s. I’m sure they’re digital, but the art is so very reminiscent of the watercolour backgrounds from the OG anime and it’s just 💋👌

Just my two cents. I would love to have a couple high quality prints of these backgrounds."
TongueTwistingTiger,ENFP,"Hi! So, I'm an employee of a company who generates marketing materials. As a result, mail is kinda part of my job. I've noticed that Surrey operates on mostly a numbered Street type of system (128th St. etc) Can someone explain why this is? Also... how do you find that system works? I feel like I would get lost as hell driving around time.

Example: 103 - 239994 108A Ave. Does this mean suite 103 located at 239994 108th Ave?

I'm just very inquisitive, and want to understand what's going on so I don't unintentionally screw something up (which I do often...)"

Nausicaa99,ENFP,"I don’t know if I am the only one, but sometimes I feel quite frustrated to not be more like the ENFP stereotype (super outgoing, always positive, spontaneous, etc). I actually wish I was more extroverted. All my friends at school are introverts and we barely see each other outside of school. No one really initiate anything, when one does, organising activities is complicated since we’re a small friend group and that generally half of the people can’t come or aren’t that enthusiastic about it. What’s frustrating is that we’re quite disconnected from the rest of the people at school, and I always have to listen to everyone talking about their parties and the cool things they do and I always feel like missing out on something and it feels horrible. I also wonder why we’re not included, I know that it probably hasn’t anything to do with me but every time I still wonder if there’s anything wrong with me (even if I know it’s not the case)

Maybe I’m just idealising what parties are, but I don’t really know what to do to feel like I live my life fully and to feel included and valued (yes I know it sounds selfish lmao)
(But I also don’t want to force people to invite me because it would be so awkward)
Of course I’m still really glad to have my friends, they’re all amazing and I’m so lucky to have them

That feeling that we’re kinda misfits is just quite annoying sometimes 

Thank you if you read this to the end, I just needed to vent about this💖

(Also am I a real ENFP despite not acting that much like an extrovert? I relate more to the ENFP   description than the INFP one though...)

Edit: (hello btw, I forgot to be polite >w<)"
OshuSupreme,ENTP,"This is just a nice little love letter to ENFPs from an ENTP, you guys are so beautiful, amazing, funny, charismatic and smart.

•	How good are you at strategizing? Do you easily break up projects into manageable tasks? Or do you have a tendency to wing projects and improvise as you go?

•	Imagine you are alone in a blank, empty room. There is nothing for you to do and no one to talk to. What do you think about?

(Yah at times so people can shut the fuck up. Or even because I don’t care enough about the topic.)

•	Do you break rules often? Do you think authority should be challenged, or that they know better? If you do break rules, why?

(I tend to break the rules within my house only small ones like eating in my room because I genuinely believe it’s dumb, at work I follow the rules at times when the bosses leaving I would break the rules with a few coworkers to have fun, rules tend to be stupid but I will follow if needs be)"

OshuSupreme,ENTP,"Appreciation post or whatever, hey you guys are pretty cool snd not just a bunch of sensitive crybabies like everyone says

A lot of the best game devs, philosophers, artist, authors and many more are INFPs, shoot, you have are more of polymath than us sometimes

CetriolinoBiricchino,ENTP,"Hey yo, ENTP here.

I've heard several times that an ENTP 2(w3, in this case) doesn't exist BUT I'M HERE! I EXIST!

Now I’m trying to figure out why people say that. It's something about stereotypes? Like BASTARDS ENTPs and cutie 2s? I'm both.

Someone can explain it to me? Thanks"
VincitT,INFP,"Hey fam!  My INTP buddy is convinced that following what you love for a career kills all the joy in it.  I'm wondering you guys have any experience in this whether you went on to great success and joy or whether you just had to stop?

I know from experience I studied music after high school and it really did fall off for me, but I think there were more reasons than just having to do it a lot (ie not being able to express myself in ways I really want to like in writing/art)

Any artists (or other passion seekers) out there that that love it after a long time??"
VincitT,INFP,"Hi amazing ENFPs!  I need some help with a buddy of mine.  We were besties for half our lives and hes such an awesome dude, but he went though a really messy time with his wife (now ex) and has gone into what I think is full retreat mode from his old life. 

He was blamed heavily for what happened (and admittedly he made some poor choices) but I 100% believe how he was treated was a huge part of what led him there.  I dont blame him for what happened, but I think he blames himself a lot and through shame he has retreated from everyone who is associated with his past life.  

I want to be a support for him and help work through what happened to make sure he knows hes still a great guy and how to get past this, but I find it difficult to get him to respond much.

I have been texting him every month or two to say hi and wish him well, and only really get a response occasionally which is fine, I just want to be there for him.  I think I have insight for him that hes probably not getting from others at this point.  Hes mentioned he'd like to catch up sometime but hasn't committed to anything.  Says hes bad at responding and such

Do you guys have any ideas what I might be able to do to get back in real touch with him? I'm tempted to go full honesty and call things out but of course I dont know if hes gonna respond to that lol but we dont talk anymore anyway so I'm at the point I'd like to try anything to get that friendship back.  Honestly, I feel like I should appologize for not being a better support for him earlier when things were getting worse...

We used to click so well on a deeper level and I think he could really use a friend like that (And I totally miss him as well lol)

Let me know what you think!"
VincitT,INFP,"Hey guys, I'm a father of a cute 2 y/o munchkin who is a handful but I love him to bits!  I find I spend quite a bit of time with him as well as juggle working from home (office job blahhh) during the day.  I'm honestly super lucky i get to do that, so no real complaint there, and my wife is in the same boat so we try to support each other and trade off work/toddler time.

I have my evenings free these days, but I'm finding it so difficult to do anything other than relax and veg for a couple hours before bed.  I feel like I just want to go into recovery mode to be able to take on the next day.  I really want to get into writing a lot more, but I feel like being creative still takes effort and I fall into getting jealous of my bit of free time and end up gaming or watching a movie.

For you parents out there, when do you find time to pursue creative pursuits?  If it's at the end of the day, do you still have energy, or do you find it energizing in itself?

Thanks for being awesome!"
VincitT,INFP,"* **Total budget and country of purchase:** 
$600-700 CAD, Canada, as mentioned above, if i need to increase my budget, let me know.  i would much rather wait than throw money away on a machine I'm going to hate in a few months

* **Do you prefer a 2 in 1 form factor, good battery life or best specifications for the money? Pick or include any that apply.** 
 Best specs are priority

* **How important is weight and thinness to you?**
 Not super important. My last laptop was a beast and i dont mind carrying around some extra weight.  Writing in fun comfy locations is appealing though

* **Which OS do you require? Windows, Mac, Chrome OS, Linux.**
 Windows plz!

* **Do you have a preferred screen size? If indifferent, put N/A.** 
 15"" at least

* **Are you doing any CAD/video editing/photo editing/gaming? List which programs/games you desire to run.** 
 Photoshop, lightroom, might get into basic animation but only for kicks

* **If you're gaming, do you have certain games you want to play? At what settings and FPS do you want?** 
 Gaming is secondary as i have a decent desktop. Would love to play stuff like factorio, starcraft2 but not a priority

* **Any specific requirements such as good keyboard, reliable build quality, touch-screen, finger-print reader, optical drive or good input devices (keyboard/touchpad)?** 
 Good comfortable keyboard for extended writing would be awesome.  A frustrating keyboard could be a deal breaker unless a good portable plug in one is a better option

* **Leave any finishing thoughts here that you may feel are necessary and beneficial to the discussion.**
 I'm struggling to find a good laptop that will work for both. With writing, comfort is really the main concern as it doesnt have many specific requirements of the machine. Display and color is very important for the photoshop side.  I find most in this range have TN monitors?  I'm getting the impression this is something i would want to avoid

Thanks for your help!"
Lassinportland,ENFP,"I got stood up and then went on a date with a different person who I did not connect with!

But fuck it, I'm not upset. Dating is work and I'm going to put the effort in. I know I'm a hot piece. I might be drunk now and playing Zelda, but I'm gonna get out there again and meet more people moving forward! (Safely with a lot of covid precaution)"
Lassinportland,ENFP,"I'm at my fork in the road where I've already chosen to chase my dreams instead of the person who might end up being the one who got away.

Please share your stories!

** I'm reading through every comment and I'm feeling a lot of emotions. Thank you to everyone sharing! I will get back to everyone --

Still working through the comments.. the last few days had me feeling down and not myself then I decided to post this. I wasn't expecting to read through so many encouraging words, teary-eyed stories, and feel the strength of so many ambitious women. Thank you all for taking the time to share your thoughts and motivations."
Lassinportland,ENFP,"I (27F) started seeing an old friend (27M) on a romantic level recently and I noticed that things he said, or did, made me feel a genuine type of appreciation and caring that I'd never experienced in past relationships. For context, I've been in several relationships and the last one was long term. 

Diving right into it: 

When I get passionate in conversation, he listens, then hours later he'll repeat what I'd said to him sometimes with questions to further explore my thoughts, proving that he was present and interested in ME (all caps to emphasize me the human being)

I told him a story about a sexist experience of mine, and he listened, didn't suggest what I could've done or should've done, and made me feel supported. (Id always felt uncomfortable with myself that I had to confront someone - like i was the bad guy because I wasn't complying to the feminine image I was raised to standardize)

We were having a silly conversation and I said I can be very dumb sometimes, and his immediate response was ""you're actually very smart"". I never realized that none of my ex's ever told me that, and my mind was always something I'd wanted to be seen for.

I got teary-eyed about not being able to see my best friend anymore (she was moving away), and he became sad with me. I was so used to guys being more of a boulder to lean on that didn't become sad with me if that makes sense. Seeing him feel my emotions with me made me sooo comfortable.

This was a revelation to me to have these small experiences and wanted to share that people like him exist. I'm not sure where our relationship will head as we live in different cities, but I can already see it's something to treasure..."

I just want to make music with people. No fame or anything just a freaking a bar band, killing it every Saturday night."
grnshoes,ENTP,"Do you find that when you are really down you crave nostalgia? For me it’s reading old books I loved as a kid or movies. Sometimes it’s like a sign something is wrong, like If I’m trying to get back to Hogwarts, something is amiss. My father (also ENTP) seems to do this more with objects.

Other_Broccoli,ENFP,"Hi all,

I'm looking for a travel bag for the Celestron AstroMaster 80EQ. I want to carry it safely and conveniently. And by that I mean all its parts: the tripod, the equatorial mount, the telescope tube, the knobs, oculars, motordrive and counterweights. I've been looking online but it seems to me all the travel bags for this telescope are for the tube only. Maybe I'm wrong about that but because of covid I can't go to the store.

I would just like to take it with me when we go discover the dark skies of Europe (for example in the south centre of France between Clermont-Ferrand and Limoges). 

Thanks in advance for your two cents on this.

PS. Yesterday I got hooked on my new hobby. We were able to see the moon in such amazing detail. Far beyond what my little telescope I used to own when I was 12 years old could do. We also saw Sirius, Betelgeuse and Procyon. We had seen Rigel, Polaris and the Pleiades before, but it was for more strenuous and the nights were way colder then. Let me just say I really look forward to clear summer night skies."
Other_Broccoli,ENFP,"So my girlfriend and I were watching a film today. We were planning on viewing the moon and some stars later tonight with our telescope. We bought the thing not even a month ago and already got to see some stars. But the clear nights were cold and we were new to gazing so it was cool, but not as cool as I had hoped. Back to today: we had just returned from a walk and some chill time in the park. My girlfriend looked up from the film and yelled: ""wow, look at the moon!"" It was amazing. I decided we had to look through the telescope. It was brilliant. The moon was enchanting, the stars where shining brighter each minute in the dusk. We got to see Sirius, Procyon and Betelgeuse. We are hooked. What a great hobby and the best money ever spent! :)

The movie we were watching: deadpool. Got to say I enjoyed the moon and stars more."
Other_Broccoli,ENFP,"To all citizens of Sercliffe,

It is with great disappointment that I, the leader of Air and Help Party, announce that I feel obligated to stop and dissolve the party. Unfortunately, due to personal business I cannot commit myself to co-lead our great country. Therefore from here on forth we do not longer exist.

I want to thank all our voters and supporters. I'm very sorry that I have to make this decision. I wish it wouldn't be necessary but you deserve an active government and at the moment I'm not able to grant you that.

So I say farewell for now and hope that our paths may cross again.

I wish you all happy holiidays and an amazing new year.

1fineapple,ENFP,"Why do people do this? I have unending anxiety from conversations with coworkers during work from home because they use a period at the end of everything. “Ok.”, “You’re welcome.”, “Thanks.” Are they mad at me or are they perfectly happy? I have no idea! If we as a society could stop this, my mental health would be a thousand times better. While I know some will say it’s a me problem and I shouldn’t take it personally, oftentimes this is the only way I communicate with certain coworkers every day. I thought this group might understand and feel my pain 😭"
RubixCubeXD,ENTP,"Hello people! I will be sharing my take on each of the alignments that match the types. I grouped each type by their same top two functions as I figured those are the ones who would resonate with the same alignment to fit every 16 types.  

Some things to note, a few of the definitions for the alignments may be slightly different as for a more accurate representation, it was best to build some system around the alignment definitions, such as making it more dynamic and adding more reassurance to the definitions. This is a priority system meaning it represents which alignment a type *prioritises* so they can easily relate with other alignments but only *secondarily*. An ENTP could relate to the alignment of Lawful Good because they share the same functions of an ISFJ, however, it's only secondary, not primarily. 

Also, this is all based on the natural behaviours a type has. Any person can develop other alignment traits throughout their life but they all start a particular way.

TRUE NEUTRAL DOES NOT EXIST! I maintain True Neutral being impossible to exist as this is a priority system meaning it is about what you prioritise. For example, if you're Lawful Neutral, it means you prioritise Lawful behaviours heavily and not care so much about Good vs Evil. Every human being has a bias! 

Let's break down each of the alignments: 

*Lawful* - Lawful is focused on a system of rules. It's about dictatorship and doing things the best way possible. It's about the standard, plans and order. It believes that a system of standards is needed for efficiency or harmony.

*Chaotic* - Chaotic seeks to rebel against the system and flow with a more disruptive approach for the sake of freedom. It doesn't want to be pinned down by procedures or rules but instead, let life happen however it wants. It values their freedom as well as the freedom of others the most. 

*Neutral* - Neutral takes a more relaxed approach, it doesn't always want to be pinned down by rules, but it also won't go as far as to cause disruption. It follows the rules that align with its agenda, that it agrees with. They are the ones who will protest peacefully. 

*Good* - Good always seeks to help out other people, they like to understand what other people value. They can sometimes self-sacrifice, however, they may be at risk of forcing their help onto others or expecting something in return for their help. 

*Evil* - Evil tries to find what it values and finds meaningful. They care very highly about their voice and opinions and seeks to be heard. They seek to be settled and happy with what they have so they can return the favour but are at risk of stepping on others 

*Neutral* - Neutral doesn't go out of their way to help out everyone but also wouldn't go as far as to harm others for profit. They simply don't care that much about looking at life through Good/Bad but instead what is necessary. 

THE TYPES: + Lose definitions

*Lawful Good* - *ISFJ, ESFJ* Lawful Good seeks to maintain harmony with a system they have their full faith in. However, they are at risk of close-mindedness.

*Neutral Good* - *INFJ, ENFJ* Neutral Good seeks to understand people of all kinds and giving others a chance, however are at risk of high enabling and mirroring the wrong people. 

*Chaotic Good* - *ISTP, ESTP* Chaotic Good seeks to test the rules for the greater good and choose what they think will help others making them at risk of high stubbornness and being abusive. 

*Lawful Neutral* - *INTJ, ENTJ* Lawful Neutral seeks to create a controlled system that is perfect and efficient but are at risk of perfectionism and a superiority complex. 

*Chaotic Neutral* - *INTP, ENTP* Chaotic Neutral seeks to view everything in a neutral lens for the sake of truth. They may justify themselves doing an evil act by doing good and end up believing in an eye for an eye. 

*Lawful Evil* - *ISTJ, ESTJ* Lawful Evil seeks to follow along with the established rules and ways of life to try and gain a position of power for themselves. 

*Neutral Evil* - *INFP, ENFP* Neutral Evil seeks to uphold what they value above all and have a motive. They may follow alliances to secretly get something out of it and are only motivated if they know what they're getting. 

*Chaotic Evil* - *ISFP, ESFP* Chaotic Evil seeks to cause a spark in the world and create a spotlight for themselves. What they value is everything but so is showing it off to others. This can cause them to be abusive with their freedom."

Today i visited a dermatologist and i was diagnosed with CU, and while she was explaining it to me and what the causes could be and the tests that i should take (urine, stool, PPD, pylori, THC...) since it could range from anything to nothing.

Anything being something wrong in my body ie. an infection in a certain place, or nothing, just a messed up immune system that needs recalibration.

Also she told that she's weirded out that so many of her patients these last 2 weeks had the same problem, but she still doesn't know why and thinks it could be Covid related, due to stress and whatnot.

I'll start taking the anti-histamine today and I'll also have to do the tests tomorrow.

Also i felt weird when she asked me if it's causing any breathing or throat pain, and i was like, nah it just itches like hell 😩

Hope everyone is safe and doing well."

Blackflag7777,ENFP,"I met this woman and we've known each other from before just basically (hi's and bye's) but with not much of a real contact until recently.
So i came to like her and I'm interested in creating a FWB relationship with her. We got along pretty well, we talk, we laugh, but the thing is that she's older than me and that's why she's out and about while talking with me (i doubt that she sees me as a potential partner, and that's what i want to work on), otherwise she would have been more uptight since ik that she's a good looking, accomplished woman and guys are pursuing her. BUT I'm not putting her on a pedestal yet (that's what I'm scared of or what I'm scared that she thinks I'm doing), when we started talking i was a cool guy, not overly complimenting nor agreeing with everything that came out of her mouth and now i still am not, but the thing is at first i didn't even have this thought about her so i acted differently as if i had no agenda (weirdly it was better since i would have messed up the getting to know her phase).
But now I'm scared of how to approach her especially since presents herself at first as being proud of herself or overly confident, but after talking to her i got to know that deep down she isn't, it's just like a ""hello"" mask she puts in front of new people.

Soooo

I'm scared that if i showed interest, or complimented more, or hinted at anything, she'll know what's up (although this is the point) but she'll react negatively, as in she gets repelled because she feels I'm pursuing her.
So how do i treat this situation

wonder689,INFP,What are your thoughts on infp type?
wonder689,INFP,Atypical on Netflix. Watch it. I am sure you will relate and enjoy it. I kept thinking of my sweet introverts ppl while watching it.
wonder689,INFP,"When I was in middle school, a new girl joined our class. She was a shy and silent girl trying to adjust in new class. Now, it is common for us to learn two or more languages in school. English and some other language. 
One time we had to write an essay. Everyone wrote one, including the new girl. She had poor English skills at that time. So the essay was not upto the mark and had many grammatical mistakes. She simply wanted to write about her daily experience traveling to school by bus. But when read out aloud, it sounded weird because of lack of proper punctuation and full stop. The teacher found this essay funny. 
Next day the teacher comes in the classroom, declares what a stupid essay this new girl wrote, insults her openly for her skills and reads out the essay aloud in front of everyone. Since we were not mature enough, most students laughed at her. 
At first I didn't realize the gravity of the situation, and when I saw her face, You could see small teardrops rolling on her cheeks. I was taken aback and utterly speechless. It suddenly dawned on me what just happened. This incident broke her emotionally.
The new girl never returned to class. The last we heard, she transferred to another school.
I never forgot this incident and I still feel sorry for her and i hope she is doing alright."

Impossible_Employee3,INTJ,"hey, i wanted to ask a question. since you guys are close to my type and you have extroverted feeling and i use feeling lower in my stack, i figured you might be the best ones to ask.

if that sentence seems long it's because whenever i try to bring up this subject i start rambling *hard*. i don't know how to stop and none of it really makes sense. i don't like to say ""none"" because that's not really true. some of it does make sense, just not a lot. if i keep typing out things this way i'm going to go into an infinite regress of feelings. i was on the INFP sub today and a lot of them seem kind of like this as well, they just don't seem to have solutions. i'm thinking someone with Fe and a J would be able to help me figure out what to do with this. if anything at all.

i'll tell you about a nightmare scenario for me. sometimes this happened when i was a kid. it's a composite situation: older church leader guy sits down and plays an acoustic guitar. it's becoming an event. kids gather around and sing about jesus. they're very openly emotional, hugging each other, people sitting in each other's laps, etc.. now here i am. i'm going ok i'm glad they're getting along, but i want to get my brain engaged in something. and when i do that, i'll feel all is right with the world. i appreciate these openly emotional people as background noise, but i don't want to get involved. 

is this normal? is this healthy? 

if you want MY opinion, yeah, you're damn right this is normal and healthy. i don't want to be touched or sing about jesus. that's all. there is no *reason*, i just don't like engaging with any of this stuff. that's all. i want to be by myself and read, or something."

Impossible_Employee3,INTJ,"not too long ago it occurred to me people don't really know what i'm feeling unless i tell them. i practically never tell people what i'm feeling. then it struck me that telling people might actually work. so i started communicating in such a way that tells people how i feel.

boss: hey here's an invite to the company get-together.

me: yo. it's cool management is doing this for us. but i'm conflicted because i think i'd regret going. so i need some me time in this case. i'll spend my pto on the day of. if not i'm fine with taking unpaid time off. does that work for you?

the boss understood. however i'm a little worried i'm being too verbose; like there's a simplier way to say all that.. saying what i'm feeling even if it's robotic seems to get the point across but i'd like to present it in a more casual, less intense way.

what do you think? is it ok for me to come off robotic? is there a more straightforward way to communicate: 1) thanks for the invite, 2) SOUNDS DRAINING NO THANK YOU, 3) i need to take care of myself?"
Impossible_Employee3,INTJ,"greetings, INTPs. here's something i've always been curious about. how do you experience introverted thinking? what sparks your curiosity? what do you think about most of the time? do you have a good grasp on what's rational versus irrational? does curiosity even have anything to do with Ti?

Impossible_Employee3,INTJ,"good morning ENFP friends.

with ENFPs it seems like you rather enjoy it when an INTJ is sarcastic or pithy. we like you because you tend to catch our sarcasm and it leads to a lot of fun conversation.

however, sometimes the conversation flow halts just after I've said something sarcastic. I'm not sure if this means the sarcasm didn't sell, or if the ENFP is hurt.

I don't want you to hurt. 😢

because of my robotic nature, I am blind to how you might be feeling.

perhaps you could give me a rule of thumb."
Impossible_Employee3,INTJ,"today I was reviewing an account at work and I became curious why a particular business is handling their operations in a particular way.

ilovedinos666,ENFP,"Things have been really hard for me lately, and I just want to put it all out there and seek support on this sub. In the past few years, my dad passed away, I entered a relationship with an infj who I was friends with forever beforehand, it was my first time in a lesbian relationship and it was with my best friend ever. It ended up in toxic shambles. She pushed me down while I was trying to get in my car over and over, her father threatened to sue me over false accusations, and she took our cat that we shared that I loved after the breakup. She would use suicide threats as a way to have power over me. A few months before our breakup my sister went into surgery and ended up with very bad complications, that was two years ago this month and she is still suffering from the after affects. It’s been the hardest thing watching her suffer, not being able to talk, eating through a tube, having muscle contractions for majority of the day until she takes her meds that have awful side effects just to be somewhat more calm. My mom is her primary care taker but she’s going through burnout being a 24/7 nurse and will get very harsh and cold when she gets tired to the point where she’s emotionally abusive to my sister. When I try to talk to her about it she completely and brutally tears me down as a person and even punched me and pulled my hair the other day. Most of my friends have left me. And to make matters worse my boyfriend (another infj) just left me but to be fair I deserve it. We are very on and off and when we’re off I end up getting drunk and sleeping with my intj best friend. When me and infj get back together he ends up feeling betrayed and like he’s not enough. Every infj ive dated tends to be very low self esteem/suicidal. I try to help but I feel as if I just make things worse. I stopped seeing my therapist. My social anxiety has gotten so much worse in the pandemic. My mom and my older sister only have negative and degrading things to say about me. My great grandpa who I love even accused me of doing porn the other day and didn’t believe me when I told him I don’t. I have nothing against sex work that is safe and consensual for all parties, but it felt like it came out of no where. I thought he still saw me as a kid, and I also don’t do porn. I struggle with addiction. I try to always see the positive even though life has been awful lately but I feel totally alone. I don’t know what to do. 

I’m sitting in a hotel room right now. Terrified to be alone. I am in the middle of getting a degree I don’t even want. I am broke, I am in debt. I don’t know how to “adult” properly. I feel like I have some wisdom but it makes me feel scared of the world. I am tired of going back and forth with my boyfriend. I’m tired of being misunderstood. I feel like things just keep getting worse. 

I lived with my sister for the last year and half but I moved out last month because it was really toxic for me. Her and her husband made very few attempts to actually make me feel welcome and I would hold myself up in my room feeling to anxious to leave it. I keep trying to pick up the pieces and get better and I know progress isn’t a straight line but it feels like a pendulum is constantly going at some crazy fast rate in my head, my heart, my life."

I'm not good with groups, if anything even if I am able to overcome my anxiety it seems to always happen that people en mass don't really appreciate my side of things. So yeah.

Fun-Carpenter8923,ENFP,"Recently, I realised I may hv jumped out of the hot pot into the fire below. 

I used to be willingly ignorant, buried my head in the sand & ran from uncomfy things. Resistance, both feeling and fighting. I realised i may no longer have been hiding but i was fighting everyday. My thoughts, my life & the unfortunate ppl who happened to be around. My recently high irritability was a sign tht i was resisting my reality. 

With this new found perspective I stopped fighting & i stopped trying so hard. The only time i tried today was when  the noise was so loud tht some effort was needed to stay detached. To stay put, to see without eyes & know without mind. 

Later tht day I dreamt of a-lot but a crow was wht stuck. I thought I had woken up in this dream only to find a crow out of place perched at the foot of my bed.  Half asleep I tried to shoo the crow with a lethargic foot, The crow shooed me away instead and then continued to go about its daily tasks of preening and peering around. Its feathers looked glossy with the backdrop of blue light which I assumed was telling of the time so around 10-11 pm. 

I do find the subconscious mind  & dreams to be interesting. Just wht do they mean? Whts the point of them existing? So as soon as i actually awoke to tht sm blue light telling of it actually being 10:53 pm i  decided to search up the foreboding strange crow.

**TheCrow signifies change.** This is to say “Do not be afraid” & to “know tht u will need to address such issues inorder to restore harmony.” - Crow 

Strange & a little unsettling experience especially after  a juicy nightmare about Werewolves. But thxs for the encouraging words ig crow. Change is needed.

rubber_duck_dude,ENFP,"I'm a first-year biomed student, but due to current circumstances that I'm sure you're all aware of, this year sucked for me in multiple ways and I only did three subjects in Sem 1 and Sem 2 to try and make things a bit easier for me. I decided to drop EDDA and MFB as they weren't prereqs for any core subjects, and I had a really bad experience in Sem 1 with learning maths online so I figured that I'd just wait for in-person classes to go back. 

Problem is I don't know when they're going back and now I'm looking at picking my second year subjects with online learning in mind. I think I'm going to try going back to four subjects next year and see how I go - but I'm thinking of saving EDDA and MFB for fourth year and doing my two science breadths next year instead. Mainly because I want to do them with some of my friends, but also because I've heard that the two maths subjects are pretty easy to get good marks in and I kind of want to save them to try and boost my third year GPA for med entry. 

Would any other biomed students be able to tell me whether it would be ok for me to save EDDA and MFB until my fourth year of uni? Will the knowledge you get from these subjects be useful in second and third year? I'm assuming they're first year subjects for a reason, but I just wanted to see how other students felt about their content.

Just as some background - I did methods (A-student) and specialist (more of a B-student) maths in high school, but this was in QLD so I imagine the content was a bit different. I would consider myself generally pretty good at maths, but not amazing."
rubber_duck_dude,ENFP,"Backstory: I'm nearly 20, and I moved out of my Ndad's house the moment I was 18 and had a safe place to stay. I now live with an incredible roommate. <3 We hang out a lot and treat each other like family but we each do our own thing when it comes to cooking/cleaning/washing whatever. I basically have all the responsibilities of someone who lives by themselves, I just share the space with another beautiful human. 

Just a few minutes ago I was complaining to some older people (in their 30s) about how I had to go do groceries tomorrow and run some errands and I was like ""heh being an adult is hard hey."" 

And they all just looked at me and one of them goes ""you're not an adult"" and i was so confused like ""dude I'm over 18 (adult age in Australia) and I moved out of home two years ago."" And then another lady said ""yeah but you're in a stage of life where you don't have *real* responsibilities yet, you know? Just enjoy it while you can!"" 

I don't know why but this made me so irrationally angry and I'm nearly in tears thinking about it. Yeah, at the moment I only look after myself, but I spent a good ten years of my life doing all the cleaning and the majority of the cooking for my family of five. I could clean your entire house and make you a meal out of a cardboard box and a tomato in under three hours because that was the environment I was raised in. I was terrified of my dad and his temper.

I didn't move out of home because I wanted to. I would LOVE nothing more than to have a safe, friendly home environment at my parent's. I would have loved to have stayed there until I'd finished uni and had some money in my savings. I would have loved for my dad to show me the ropes of adulthood, but instead I was thrown in the deep end and had to figure it out myself. 

I worked full time for two years after high school and saved like crazy so I'd have enough money to support myself through uni. My dad occasionally sends me what I like to call ""guilt money"" but that's the only financial assistance I'm getting from him. My parents haven't payed a cent of my uni bills, my car bills, or any of my bills. I've been on my own since I was 18. 

Yet because I'm so young and I don't talk much about the horrible relationship I have with my parents, people still treat me like a kid. They have absolutely no idea how much I've gone through in the past couple of years and they look down on me and go ""awwww sweetie wait till you reach REAL adulthood"". They have no idea how much it hurts when I realise that no one knows I basically raised myself and my little sister. They have no idea how many nights I've cried myself to sleep wishing that I wasn't so alone and I had a family I could rely on. 

The worst part is that this is a frequent conversation I have and it upsets me every time. I try not to bring up the whole ""adulting"" thing with people older than me but for some reason I trusted these people. And even though I wanted to release the burning rage in my stomach, I just bit my tongue and went ""haha yeah I guess you're right"" because I knew I would get upset over it and they'd think I was some irrational teenager who couldn't put her problems into perspective. 

If you made it this far, I appreciate you. Thanks for letting me have a safe space to rant <3

Edit: Thank you so much for all the encouraging comments!! I would reply to all of you individually but I'd probably just be saying the same thing so I want you to know that your words mean a lot to me!! <3"

rubber_duck_dude,ENFP,"First year undergrad here - has anyone in this sub done their Diploma in Languages? Would you say it was worth the extra year it added onto your study? I'm taking first year subjects in a language this year and I've been really enjoying it, probably more so than my actual degree's subjects. 

I'm looking to apply for post-grad medicine after I get my bachelor's and half of me just wants to get into med school and get it over with but the other half of me is thinking an extra year is just a year and the opportunities you can get from doing a diploma seem like they might be worth it. There's the possibility to go on exchange, you become fluent in another language, and you have an extra qualification you can add to your resume. As a HECS student apparently I'm also eligible to do half my diploma subjects for free, which seems like a pretty good deal? The other half of the diploma subjects would count as breadth towards my main degree anyway. 

I can't find much information at all online from other people who've done this and I know uni can oversell things sometimes so would appreciate any input you might have! Thanks \^\_\^"
rubber_duck_dude,ENFP,"Hi guys! I am stuck at home, like most of you! 

Except I'm a uni student and my uni somehow expects me to work productively in my room. When, not once in my entire life, have I been able to productively study in my room. >\_<

Could someone please share their study habits with me? I will take any advice I can get at this stage. I was studying at 2 AM on Saturday night while hanging upside down off the edge of my bed because I was just. so. bored. but also so stressed that I couldn't sleep. The only thing that seems to work for me at the moment is getting up really early and getting in a couple of hours before my family wakes up. Surely there has to be a better way of doing this??

rubber_duck_dude,ENFP,"My chem, bio and calc classes have all made plans to go online and I think i got like 10 emails between those three classes just this afternoon as the subject coordinators are racing to change everything, but I havent heard a thing from the russian people.

Not sure if it's because russian is just a tiny cohort or because the language faculty just isn't sure how to switch to an online format. I also know my stream is < 25 people so at this point i dont think it's mandatory for them to switch over.

Just wondering if any other language kids have heard anything yet?"
rubber_duck_dude,ENFP,"Everybody loves ESTPs, ESFPs, and ENTPs. You see them out partying all the time, they have a ton of friends, and they're loads of fun to be around. The ExxP family is crazy and impulsive and should really just shut up and let someone else talk for once but everyone loves them anyway.

But I feel like we don't relate to our ExxP cousins as much. Like we might be spontaneous and easily excited but everyone who knows us sees us as a bit weird (whether that be in a good or bad way). We didn't get the cool kid charm that the other ExxPs got. Instead, we're just, us, I guess."
notmanicpixiegirl,ENFP,"Like that’s happened to me before and I couldn’t understand why I’d be singled out and treated like a kid and stuff or criticized so much. Like my first best friend group was with an INFJ, ENFJ and ESFJ. We hung out everyday, they were perfectionists and had their shit together and perfect grades and extracurriculars. They DID influence me to be better but they also made me feel like shit about it constantly and would belittle me.

One on one the friendships were great but when it was all of us they would get annoying to me.

The next time that happened it was a different ENFJ, INTJ, and ISFJ. For whatever reason they were more chill, they still influenced me to be better but appreciated how I was and didn’t belittle me. Honestly hanging out with them helped me be organized wayy more because it would feel like they were supporting me instead."
notmanicpixiegirl,ENFP,"I see this nonstop that if a character or someone is very quirky, so random, weird, oddball, people jump to ENFP without a second thought.

I feel because of this ENFPs are one of the most mistyped types, and also the most stereotyped.

ENFPs are often usually strange but not always in their behavior or actions, but specifically just in their thought process. 

ANY type can have any kind of persona they choose to project to the world. ESFPs, INFPs, ESFJs, can all choose to adopt a quirky so random persona. Someone’s persona =/ what their type is.

In the show New Girl, people quickly type Jess as an ENFP for her bizarre, quirky, weirdo, bubbly, cute persona. And that’s also a problem is ENFPs are almost exclusively treated like a trope. 

However when it comes to her behavior and how she processes she’s a very clear Fe dom. She’s always referencing the groups emotions and what they want, and enjoys taking care of everybody else often at her own expense, instead of using herself, her identity and individuality and what she wants as a reference point. She seems to value tradition a bit too with her interests. But she does have a more childish Ne lower in the stack and is open minded. She’s a very obvious ESFJ that is strong with Fe and Ne.

When I saw her typed as an ENFP I was thinking why I can’t really relate to her. I was like I guess I can be quirky sometimes?? A lot of her behavior seems very showy and forced, and that’s not really what Ne is. Ne is more of a mental thing that makes possibilities and connections all the time, not just wearing crazy clothes and dancing, and acting overly bizarre. Her thought process wasn’t really like mine, she’s an extreme people person, and I couldn’t really relate to that extent. I’m more tuned into myself. I CAN be empathetic but not in the way that I reference other people automatically, and not myself.

I realize I feel that way with a lot of ENFP characters where I can’t relate to them. Except in Anne with an E the tv show it was like watching myself. She actually prioritizes imagination and ideas, not just being a weird oddball persona alone.

I’m just really annoyed of ENFPs being treated like a trope, it makes me feel even more misunderstood like I can’t even relate to my own personality type. And then some people dislike ENFPs based off the trope of us being over the top bubbly people that are forcibly quirky and weird nonstop, when that’s not true.

IRL, I’ve been described as laidback and go with the flow and creative with my thought process instead.

Tbh the truest quirky type in my opinion is ESFJs. I’d say dom Fe+Ne together like that makes for a much more emotionally warm, open, quirky, weird, loveable, cute person or someone who likes that persona. 

But that just isn’t me. As an ENFP I rely on mental stimulation and ideas, and imagination and I can be energetic but not in a forced kind of way where it’s a persona, I’m just excited about my own ideas and the buzz of the creative process that spirals. And I can want to help and uplift others, but I always refer to myself and my individuality first. And tbh the way an ENFP uplifts people is just from being themselves, not from automatically tuning into what other people need."
notmanicpixiegirl,ENFP,"So I have PTSD and got dissociative issues but a huge problem right now is that I’m just alone. I graduated hs almost 2 years ago and drifted from most of my friends and then I was lonely as crap.

I had 2 best friends left but they moved. And the rest of my friends I drifted with went to college. 

Basically I had to readjust to being completely alone and train myself to be hyper independent. Especially doing PTSD without any emotional support or people to talk to and laugh with and be a distraction, has been like a nightmare. 

Working at jobs have been okay but I need more than in work friends like I want people I’m close to who I can call and hang out with. And then I had to take off work for recovery from health issues and it’s been hellll being by myself.

I’ve been alone for so long and trying to cope but I can’t do it anymore. The dissociation and stress of the PTSD in combination with the loneliness has been making me feel panicky and detached from reality. I’m at the point where I’ll just go get more help but it sucks because I’m still alone.

I miss like human connection and relating with people I literally have started talking to myself to cope but still I miss the mental stimulation of talking to other people ugh. 

I’m worried that my wittiness and quick thinking is gone after being by myself and under stress for too long too, like I really don’t want to be a slow thinker because of this :(( I want to be able to still spiral with a hundred thoughts and ideas at once all the time, because that was so much fun.

I’m so adjusted to loneliness I barely even need social interaction as much now like if I talked to a friend once a month I’d be good. 

Like I know I keep coping so I don’t panic over it but it’s just exhausting and I wish I didn’t have to cope so much."
notmanicpixiegirl,ENFP,"So much has happened and I have no idea where to turn to for help with this. Sorry this is a lot 😭

So it started when I was 16-18 went through a severely traumatic experience with a guy in high school I dated that stalked me, assaulted me multiple times, held me hostage in the relationship with threats, hacked me and deleted all my personal info, isolated me from friends and ruined my rep, and just did hundreds of other sadistic obsessive things with the goal of ruining me. In his mind he was punishing me for trying to leave him, and then he was punishing me for going to the police.

It ended with me developing Stockholm syndrome out of terror towards him and then losing my mind and trying to end it.

And then that situation ended and for the next year 18-19 I just relived like 50-100 traumas on a loop and felt completely detached from reality and developed new mental issues. I lost memories of the most extreme traumas but kept having emotional flashbacks towards it even though I didn’t know what “it” was. I kept describing my brain as being a “soup of trauma”. Nothing was working in my mind anymore and I didn’t understand anything. I was scared that I was losing my mind.

I was in therapy but it wasn’t helping at all. I just kept being giving coping mechanisms on how to distract from the trauma.

And then before turning 19 I was in my car one day and just started like crying and demanding that the universe helps me. Idk I was like “well I’m real and I’m alive so HELP me.”

And then the next day I sat down randomly and decided to just close my eyes and imagine I’m somewhere peaceful like a beach. And then I accidentally meditated for the first time and went deep in the meditation for like an hour. Once it was over I couldn’t remember what happened while meditated but I felt extremely peaceful like I was healing and being “saved”. It was the first time I felt mental relief in years. I think I could’ve astral travelled or something I dunno.

But then I just started meditating more. I got off the antidepressants that I realized was making my trauma so much worse. The medication was making everything even more fuzzy and confusing, and I felt more real once I was off of it. I was so upset that the medication was hurting my brain for so long without me realizing.

I kept meditating because it was making me feel really peaceful like a surge of dopamine. I realized meditating only felt that euphoric because it was compensating for the terrible state my mind was in. Once I started getting more stable meditating felt more normal.

But then I had all these spiritual experiences, for example the first thing that happened was I got a vision of this beautiful woman in my mind covered in jewels with golden skin. I felt so peaceful and safe after seeing her. I later found out that was the Hindu goddess Durga and saw the exact image online I’d seen in my mind.

I had these frequent spiritual dreams that would happen while waking up or falling asleep. It would feel like I was traveling through space and time and being given insight into the universe and existence. It felt euphoric in the sense that it was magical. I’d wake up and not consciously remember what it was but I felt like I knew somehow.

I became extremely psychic and could predict anything and felt connected to everything. It felt like I had all the insight to the universe very effortlessly in a calm way.

There were these weird things that happened sometimes when I was laying down or like randomly. Where I’d just feel this euphoric energy go through my body like spreading down to my toes and everything. It was honestly the best feeling ever. I didn’t know what it was I thought it was maybe just some stress response to my PTSD. But now I think that was Kundalini.

I felt this sense of expanded consciousness, it reminded me of how weed used to feel except 10x better, and I felt completely sober. Like I’d look around and feel so connected to everything and content. It felt like life had been a dream and I was finally “awake” and really alive.

Then I had this one thing happen when I meditated for only like 10-20 mins. I was picturing myself by the ocean like I usually did. And then I got deep in the meditation and saw like a lover hugging me from behind while standing on the beach and I felt unconditional love and peace. And then me and him both like warped into space and then I was at peace in infinity realizing life is just a rat maze and how small everything is. It felt amazing and I was happy af.

I was repulsed by junk food and unhealthy things, and started eating salads, grains, fruit and craving it. I felt like I had so much energy and life force. I didn’t know what kundalini was yet so I didn’t know what was happening I was just rolling with the bliss.

Everything was happening so smoothly and it felt like I was protected by the Hindu Goddess like she knew I was in crisis and was trying to save me. But there was a problem, I had a job at this restaurant, and every time I’d have to work, it would throw off the spiritual stuff.

All I wanted to do was quit so I could be at peace for a while. But it’s hard to explain to your parents that you want to quit your job so you can sit in nature all day.

I just felt so urged to stop working and not do drugs and be healthier and be in solitude with nature. I also got overwhelming feelings of my life purpose and exactly what I’m supposed to do with creativity and writing to help the world.

But every time I’d work, I’d lose the peaceful feelings. And then on my days off it would come back again, and then it would go away again. This back and forth gave me whiplash. Whenever it would go away I’d be left feeling depressed and traumatized again. This made me question if I needed to heal my ego self instead of just abandoning it to be happy and spiritual.

And so winter came and this threw me off more because I hate the cold and couldn’t be in nature anymore. And then I got seasonal depression. At this point I quit my job for the sake of my spiritual feelings, but my spiritual feelings weren’t coming back as it was before. I just felt intense depression and all my trauma. I was trying to heal it and I actually was working through the trauma with shadow work but at the same time, I was overdoing it because I had nothing else in life, it was just trauma.

So I did that for about 2 months. I still felt withdrawn and didn’t want to be around anyone.

Then my only best friend invited me to visit her town and meet her other friends and I had the best time ever and everybody seemed to love me a lot and I didn’t wanna be alone anymore. They all asked me to move there and I was going to. I got super excited about it and couldn’t wait to have a new life there.

I had previously had an intense psychic vision of being in a new city with friends and fun and then it matched up with what happened there.

But anyways I know I felt pulled away from doing drugs but the thing is I feel really left out. I was always someone who liked drugs for fun and I couldn’t wait to be college age and experiment with even more drugs.

I don’t want to be a monk or a guru or have the whole universe figured out already at 19. I really really don’t. I want to experience life like everyone else and have adventures in my twenties. I want to be lost and free like everyone else. I didn’t ask for kundalini, if that is in fact what it was.

I was always an impulsive teen that got fucked up, but also I did it back then because I hated myself and my life and was depressed. So I’ll never go back to that at least, but I do wanna have fun times. Like I’m young and life is just starting I wanna do stuff of course and have the same options as everyone else.

The thing is I think my kundalini energy has become dormant. I don’t know if its bad for it to go away or not. But my plan is to maybe just live it up and do drugs and have fun for a bit before maybe meditating again and resuming kundalini stuff if it comes back.

However I was experiencing random surges of derealization and existential terror, sometimes having full blown panic attacks. Probably the worst thing I’ve ever experienced. I don’t know if it’s triggered from kundalini though, it happened when I was stressed about the ptsd and not getting enough sleep. I needed to get help for that.

I don’t really know anything though, so if anyone that knows how stuff works could help me I’ll love you because there’s no one that can help me and it sucks. I’m planning to get EMDR for PTSD but for the rest of my spiritual stuff, I’ve just been winging it."

Diamondwind99,ENFP,"Hey, new to cosplay! What are your favorite fabric stores that are relatively inexpensive but still quality? Preferably with online store/delivery option. Thanks :)"
Diamondwind99,ENFP,"This isn't really a vent, more talking into the void about something I've noticed. I've noticed that for a few fandoms I'm in, I'm quite a bit older than most of the fans. One fandom I'm in for example, I'm in my low 20s but the vast majority of people in the fandom are 12-17. I'm fine with it, they're very nice, we have a lot of fun talking about everything, we all enjoy the content. 

But sometimes it does get a bit awkward when I make a reference in the context of something in a fandom that's older than these kids, sometimes older than me (that's what happens when your parents were 80s kids), and it falls flat. It's not something I get overly frustrated about since I get it, and I've come to expect that not everyone's going to get my Princess Bride reference (even though it's disappointing because that movie's a *masterpiece*). But being old enough to have babysat most of these fans just makes me feel old. Sometimes I even wonder if I've exceeded some age limit for certain fandoms.  

Thoughts, anyone?"
doktorphun,ENFP,"I had a friend who was INFJ and we got along great. I really appreciated his depth of understanding of spiritual concepts and commitment to living an enlightened life. When I decided to move to Colorado one summer (from LA) he offered to drive with me and help me move in. Wow what a great guy! 

When I decided to move back two months later and I looked him up, he essentially said to me ""sorry man, but I drove you to Colorado because I  thought you were gone for good, so now I don’t really want to be friends anymore."" Like ""I gave you this great gift as my last act of our friendship""

Something similar happened with an INFJ girlfriend. It really hurt to have someone ""close the book"". With me (ENFP), the relationship book never really closes on someone. I would love to hear your thoughts.

IMPORTANT REVISION TO ORIGINAL POST

I just remembered that we had conversation we had after I had returned (because I didn’t understand why his attitude had changed about our friendship) where he told me that I was always talking about my problems and he couldn’t deal with it anymore. (He wernt lyin) 

I used to process my internal turmoil with others quite a bit in hopes of alleviating the discomfort. And he was an empathetic ear, so of course I shared a lot with him. And I don’t blame him for not wanting to hear that same stuff over and over.

Look at how the memory just fades like that!! 

So I guess there’s more to the story than I had remembered."
doktorphun,ENFP,"Can you see ENFP on my profile here? If not, how do I  add it?"

doktorphun,ENFP,"""Sorry. This batch cannot be found"" or something to that effect. 

Yes. This is the notification we receive when a batch has been snatched by a bot. (or so that's what the urban legend is) 

My question is, has anyone ever been given an official reason by IC as to why some batches read this and others say ""Oh no. It looks like another shopper has already accepted this batch""?"
doktorphun,ENFP,Is there a way to manually change the order of delivery for multiple order deliveries?
doktorphun,ENFP,"How do you guys deal with the Substitutions when someone selects ""Use Best Judgement""? Most people choose ""Contact Me' which creates a good opportunity to dialogue with the customer and have an opportunity to go above and beyond and be a good communicator. 

My question is this: Do you totally believe the person when they select this, or do you still ask them about certain substitutions when they seem important?

I had an order the other day at a Safeway and the produce dept was decimated. She special requested 4 boxes of ""cherry tomatoes on the vine"" what?? very specialized product in an eggshell plastic container. Of course, they didn't have any. So I subbed a different type of tomato on the vine. 

It seems that people select that option, but they don't really mean it and it feels risky to me, to just sub away without knowing if the person will appreciate my choice. 

This person didn't tip for an order over 100.00 but seemed polite when I messaged her thanking her for the opportunity to shop etc...

I look forward to reading about your experiences with this.

doktorphun,ENFP,"I'm interested in your Thoughts on this scenario.

I'm on the schedule from 2 to 3 p.m. and I get an assignment from a Target A to be delivered to a nearby location. 4 items, Prepaid. Easy order

An hour later Shipt sends me a notification for another order, same time slot, for a Target 6+ miles from the first one, 14prod/5 cat.

How does Shipt expect me to do these double orders in two different stores? 

How would you do it? or would you do it? 

And is this a glitch in their job assignment algorithm? What are your thoughts?
