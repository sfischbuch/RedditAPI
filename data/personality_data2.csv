makeuleave,ENFP,"I'm aware in the beginning of the course it's said we should do the homework, submit it for feedback and go to the next lesson. However, in the ellipses homework, I noticed an extra difficulty to the point of my arm trembling in the middle of the line since it's not used to the movement, which led into drawings that looked like I wasn't even trying my best. My will to keep going and confidence also went down big time since it's only the beginning and I seem to be already struggling.

So, with all that stated, should I redo it (not to get the shapes perfectly, simply to get to the level I see other beginners are at), or is this instance common and I should just move on?"

So here is my question
What makes your heart beat faster and are passionate about?"
magical-chihuahua,ENFP,"I am diligent about syncing my work frequently however I constantly get the error that Google Drive is not connected. I have to hit the sync button at least twice to get it to connect.   
When I went to open my project today it had logged out and none of my projects were showing. Thinking my syncs were working, I downloaded the projects again.  Apparently, it hadn't saved for the last two days and I lost about 3 chapters (even though I was syncing every 30 mins).   
Any thoughts on how to prevent this again? Even with the new auto-sync feature, I'm nervous to use this when it keeps saying Google Drive isn't connected. Which makes me super sad because I love it. But apart from exporting a word file after every writing session, I feel really insecure about using it. Any thoughts to troubleshoot this would be great. I've done updates I tried to troubleshoot but I'm at a loss. I'm on a Chromebook."

magical-chihuahua,ENFP,"I’m prepping to teach a youth theatre summer camp next week. I haven’t done this in four years so I’m feeling rusty (even though I taught acting and directed plays for 9+ years, including running a program at a private school). 

I sent in my bio and headshot and then just saw today that the music director’s bio was much more formal than mine (mine was short and playful because that’s how I roll). She has so much training, experience, and accolades that it kind of deflated me. I didn’t major in theatre, it was just something I’ve done on a community level for fun. My degrees are in other things and so my inner critic has been dumping on me with: you don’t have real credentials, they should find someone with a musical theatre degree, who do you think you are. You know, the usual crap. 

(The funny thing is I would never think this about someone else. My very favorite choreographer to work with never even went to college and has also only done community/youth theatre.)

At any rate, I feel like imposter syndrome is magnified by my ENFP personality. I am infinitely harder on myself then anyone else. At the risk of overthinking this, do ya’ll feel like this also applies to you or am I just assuming it does because it feels very ENFPish?"

adrianaie,ESTP,"I have read a lot about agoraphobia and i saw something about Exposure Therapy. I want to try it, the thing is my fear is something that happens every day: catcalling, incredibly obscene looks. things that make it really hard for me to want to keep going with the E.Therapy.
Do you have any tips? Or maybe some of you share a similar experience..

The constant harassment makes it all harder and harder. Nonetheless, I will pull through. 🌞"
