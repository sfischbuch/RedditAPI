It seems the r/AgainstHateSubreddits members are high karma redditors and moderators solely dedicated to cancelling other subreddits by planting garbage posts and report spamming. The comments on that subreddit are for the most part soulless one-liners seeking to bait one sided dialogue.

Those upvotes and comments are so fake, it must be some kind of botnet. I'm going to stay joined, and seek to nullify their attempts to brigade by participating in more trendy subreddits that actually produce content. Overall this ban was purely my win."

Managicall,INTP,"""Last night I got anonymously placed into an enormous group chat against my own free will and noticed some of my friend list had been hijacked in as well. There was no way to leave it without being reinvited or committing a friend list deletion massacre. Yes I realize the cliche as it does sound like the plot out of a SAW horror flick or this latest battle royale genre. But it was one of those usual hate groups with a Matriarch and incompetent suitor going about getting spooked and attacking other distracted users whom don't want to be a third wheel to their broken relationship.

This is something I would like to avoid and just relax in my downtime. But no, the social media platform apparently had a ""Code of Conduct"" one of those corporate things that does not acknowledge the demarcation between user and service thereby drafting us to police their chats reporting away. Now this group not only reported me to the administration therein but also most likely followed an officially mandated link to twitter passing the buck helping them dox me with yet more slander and harassment.

Apparently this marketing 2.0 craze that has hit the Internet involving Code of Conducts is geared toward cult indoctrination, profiting off the breeding of new users for the kinder demographic and I am some how to blame for this couples sterility. But this is not agriculture, we are people. If I am forced to babysit these losers then do I not deserve restitution. I owe no civic duty to these corporate overlords especially when I am a paying customer.

I'm just an individual so perhaps I don't speak for everyone and certainly not so in this case when forcibly cut off from my friends that give me love and support. However if you strike me down and ban me then you will not only lose the support of a customer, but have a martyr with a lot of time on their hands.

Horrorito,ESFP,"So, I've tested this on different occasions, and rarely really anything other.

However, I just read through the description on SimilarMinds, and dude, that's like the worse option in each of the five options. I've read the alternative for comparison. The vocabulary is all negative and derogatory, and takes a crap on each of these. I thought, okay, maybe it's like Enneagram, where it focuses on the negative aspects of people, and fears, thus focusing on the potential for growth? So, I checked xCOAI and those are all worded positively. What gives?

Is each of your interactions with SLUAN a traumatizing event making you invest in years or therapy? And if so, why are so many superheroes typed as SLUEN? Are we supposed to have any positive traits? Because you know if we get lined up for extermination, I'll fight back, right?!"
Horrorito,ESFP,"Pretty much every post here that isn't a poll seems to be questioning the same thing, *am I an ESFP or ENFP?*

I think it would be great to check the previous posts first, you might get your answer there, and more. Only if the posts haven't answered, you can then get more specific.

Here's a better test that you can take, other than the 16personalities, which is essentially a Big 5 test in disguise, which is why it's so bad at typing people's Jungian or MBTI type. Check here: [http://keys2cognition.com/explore](http://keys2cognition.com/explore)

That said, no test is omnipotent, and reading up on cognitive functions and how they act in different positions in the stack is the way to go to validate.

Exerpts from Dario Nardi's description of the perceiving functions:

In ESFP:

>Extroverted Sensing (Se) -  Trust your instincts and take action relevant to the moment and current context.  
Introverted Intuition (Ni) -  Receive ""ah-ha"" insights and realizations.

In ENFP:

>Extroverted Intuition (Ne) -  Shift a situation's dynamics and explore imaginative potential possibilities.  
>  
>Introverted Sensing (Si) -  Recall tangible data and experiences.

I've copied out the high dexterity for Se and Ne, as they're the respective dominant functions, and low dexterity for Ni and Si, because they're the inferior functions.

**ESFP description:**

>Stimulating action. Have a sense of style. Talent for presenting things in a useful way. Natural actors—engaging others. Opening up people to possibilities. Respect for freedom. Taking risks. A love of learning, especially about people. Genuine caring. Sometimes misperceive others’ intentions. 

**ENFP description:**

>Inspiring and facilitating others. Exploring perceptions. Talent for seeing what’s not being said and voicing unspoken meanings. Seek to have ideal relationships. Recognize happiness. Living out stories. Want to authentically live with themselves. Respond to insights in the creative process. Finding the magical situation. Restless hunger for discovering their direction.

Horrorito,ESFP,"I struggle to share what I'm passionate about, because I never feel good enough, and the more work I put in, the more I get sensitive to noticing what I should have done better. This I did last night, for a friend. Had to quiet it down, so that I wouldn't wake the neighbors. Although it's far from perfect, I'm not embarrassed for it (except maybe the ending).

okaymountain,ISFP,"When I first came across enneagrams I thought I was a 4. Months later I was convinced on 9. I recently bought a book and saw myself in 3. Now I’m pretty darn sure I’m a 6, but like, don’t trust my judgment on that yet, as you can see. 

Anyway, for the type 6 ISFPs, how is it like? Sixes seem more common among SJs; I can see how it’s very related to Si. But how do you think it manifests itself in of us?"
okaymountain,ISFP,"There are lots of things I admire about you guys but something that just stood out to me is that you guys aren’t afraid of taking up space. Being comfortable with taking up space can be tough, especially for introverts like me. You guys are comfortable talking a *shit* ton and being loud and expressive lol. And even though it can be draining for me to be around you guys sometimes because of this, I appreciate this trait about y’all. I think I’ll take it as a reminder to myself that I don’t have to feel uncomfortable about the space I take up either."
okaymountain,ISFP,"It's pretty common knowledge that in order to get out of the loop, you need to use your second function. Most of the advice I've seen online hasn't helped me personally, until I recently realized something that has actually been working:

Find an Se activity that will *speak* to your Fi. Honestly, walking out in nature will probably not work if you’re in the loop. The whole point of my Fi-Ni loop is that I've practically lost my ability to live in the moment. So the entire time I'm out in nature, I'd just be daydreaming about millions of future possibilities of how things might turn out (that Ni is crazy man). The trees around me and the beautiful smell of the flowers aren't giving me any workable information to get through my loop. I mean, even though being in nature might help a little bit while you’re out there, the long-term positive effects are practically non-existent. Instead, try finding an Se activity that will *stimulate your Fi*. This will be different for every person, since Fi is subjective. You need to find what works for *your* Fi. 

Try finding something that's easily accessible and doable. 

For example, watching an interesting TV show might help since your Se will be activated for your Fi. Taking lessons from the characters & seeing how they’re dealing with their problems while having your Se stimulated by the aesthetic scenes and awesome sound tracks could help out. But if you’re like me, you may be too lazy to browse through Netflix until you finally find something that sounds mildly interesting for the Fi. I personally enjoy reading non-fiction books about psychology. I also enjoy meditating and journaling. The point is to find an Se activity that actually speaks to your Fi and adds meaning to it. There has to be that *mental stimulation* that comes with the Se. And only *you* can figure out what that activity will be."

okaymountain,ISFP,"There's a small organization that reached out to me to create a website for them. They already have a website but it's very old.

So the existing website uses WordPress and I think the domain is from Cpanel. 

1. Is it possible to create a new website but use the domain from the old website? How can I do it if it is?
2. What happens to the old website if we do that?
3. Should we create a new Wordpress account for the new website or use the same account? I read about multisites but I'm a bit confused.
4. Is it a good idea to stick with Cpanel or should we switch to a new web hosting company? Is it even possible to do that if we want to use the same domain for the new website?

Thank you for your help in advance!"
okaymountain,ISFP,"Okay, long post here. 

So over the summer (June-August 2019), I got a job at a small organization as a digital media content creator. I’m a 20y/o student and have been able to build up some skills in photography, video editing, and using Adobe softwares. So my job mostly consisted of these. 

However, since my workplace was a very small organization, I didn’t have a mentor to guide me through my projects. I was expected to act like an “expert” since my managers didn’t have any digital media skills. This really messed me over because they expected ME to come up with the process of how to get things done. When I couldn’t, I’d get berated for not being efficient and for wasting time. (Which was true, because I literally got burnt out, but also unfair because I had ZERO support). I’m very creative and passionate and this was clear with one of the video projects I proposed. But being a xxxP, I struggle with sticking to one creative plan which really impacted my efficiency. And efficiency was one of the main qualities they were looking for when hiring me. 

All in all, I had a super hard time making a logical plan of how to get my projects done and then actually executing that plan (major Te stuff). I was totally burnt out by the end of my summer contract. I used to love filmmaking. It was what I wanted to pursue as a career. But I honestly lost all of my confidence and interest. Not because I lack talent, but because I don’t know how to deal with things on my own. I realized it would be impossible for me to be a freelancer. 

I was studying journalism but ended up dropping out in September, after completing my first two years. I never wanted to become a journalist so I really don’t regret the decision. I needed to take a break and rebuild myself so I’m glad I did that. So that’s where I’m at right now but the problem is that I don’t know if I’ll ever have the energy to figure out another passion.

Have any of you gone through something similar? How did you get out of it? How can I rebuild my confidence? Do you think I’ll ever feel passionate about anything again?

TL;DR: Had a summer job that required me to come up with my own project plans but my managers were not supportive at all and would constantly point out every mistake I made. I ended up losing all of my confidence and getting burnt out. Now I don’t know how to rebuild my confidence even though I know I’m talented. I also feel like I’m never going to be able to be passionate about something again. I’m drained.  I’m looking for advice or someone who’s been through something similar."
JadooGrr,ESFP,"I tried actively engaging with my anima and it sounds like some form of higher voice.
 When I ask her 
""who are you?""
 She goes: 
""The thing which you seek and require""

I get images of a burning/bright humonoid spirit almost like the divine feminine.
If she was to take the form of a human it would be some form of queen or a higher priestess

JadooGrr,ESFP,"Hello, I'm 16 year old who has recently stumbled into Jung, the anima and the animus and got curious about the stage of my anima.

Recently I've been feeling as I've been doing everything wrong my whole life, I can't properly pin point this feeling but something inside me wants to come out and as a result of that I've been being showing interest in psychology, spirituality and philosophy. Overall I'm a pretty carefree guy who wouldn't showed any interest in these topics.

Typology wise I am an ESFP, being a sensing lead and having Ni last I really seek it in other people, more in women. The role the introverted intuition plays and what I seek is guidance of some form about a reformed or a set world view since extraverted sensing is more grounded and likes to deal with practical matter as they arise, so I always dream of or are naturally drawn to women that are somewhat intellectual or wise.

I vaguely remember parts of my day dream where I dreamt of her being some kind of a forest guardian with very nurturing and wise 

The sexuality had manifested and was only to be done after some form of a meaningful ritual or bonding that took place, however my instincts were to melt with her and ""be one"" as well as protect her.

while I hate getting babied around I always feel a strong desire to talk about philosophy, spirituality and personal values. I do not want to be told what to do nor do I want someone else to fix my problems for me, all I ask for is the knowledge and wisdom from her.

In some other dreams she takes the form a more modern lady, almost like a librarian of some sort, slightly nerdy with glasses. The sexuality and my erotic desires are there but its not the drive of the relationship.

**Question**

I assume Its normal to see all stages of the anima in different women and feel attracted to the lowest one despite reaching III or IV ? after all it is biological. Is that in any way a reflection of the individual's stage? perhaps they have dabbed on the stages but aren't fully complete which is why it has its fluidity?

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

At times I feel like I'm completely full of shit and instead haven't gone past the stage 1 of anima integration. this makes me feel ashamed because of my pride, However I want to embrace the shame and work on my self even if things aren't according to my expectations.

Learning basic foundations feels so boring although It can help a lot.

justshyof15,ESFP,"I turned 40 this year and my dad (68) asked what I was going to do to celebrate.

He’s literally a professional at every single thing he does and it’s the most impressive thing about him. I’ve never met anyone as talented at anything as he is. He can fix anything, build anything, saved many lives as an incredible firefighter, dare devil extraordinaire, athletic jungle cat and he sings so beautifully. It’s crazy honestly!

I obviously worshipped him, I was his only girl amongst his 3 sons and we had a very quiet bond. Whenever I show him I am skilled at something he taught me, I can see this pride come over him. Most of my athletic skills are because he taught me, handyman skills, he taught me how to stay safe and how to fight dirty if I needed to protect myself, he taught me to be a hard worker as he held 3 jobs at times to support us all and the guy never ever complains. He was tough on the boys at times but I was his princess not that he would ever admit that to anyone. I would do something stupid and he would come into my room and say “I’ve never been prouder to have you as my daughter, but this last choice was not the best but you know that.”  He just isn’t judgmental and he will help absolutely anyone with anything and everything and he would literally come running if I even asked him to change my lightbulb😂. Coolest dad ever award!!  He has the many many scars and broken bones to prove it

Warning!  Do not ask the guy about a car engine. You will never get out of there again. He will describe every little detail of how it runs, he loves to teach and share his skills, but there comes a time when it’s just too much information lol.

Yujir0Hanma,ESTP,"Sup cousins. I made this post on the r/ESTP subreddit but of course I gotta know how it applies to the 2nd best user of Se ;)

Recently when high af I sat down and realized my reflexes are fairly good. Like def above average. Some situations that stick out:

1. Was washing dishes when a thick heavy plastic cup fell off the counter due to me swinging hard with my arms. Managed to stick my foot out quickly and kicked it back up into the air as if it was a soccer ball before catching it 

2. In high school I turned all the way around in my seat to face someone but in doing so I knocked their flask of water off their desk by accident. In 1 swoop motion the arm that knocked it off spun counter clockwise and I caught it before it could hit the ground 

3. I like to play fight a lot and occasionally brothers mom or someone will throw out some kind of shot at me, a kick, a punch, anything when I least expect it. I always manage to catch their limbs or block them with ease and no struggle, it always sends me into a laughing fit as they can't touch me no matter what they do

4. I woke up annoyed at my alarm clock and sent it flying due to trying to turn it off. I managed to catch the cord and yanked it back to me before it went out of my reach and slammed into my wall, it def would have been busted if I wasn't able to react quickly.

That's just a few instances that immediately come to mind. I know I can't be the only one here with this ability, share your stories below!"

2. In high school I turned all the way around in my seat to face someone but in doing so I knocked their flask of water off their desk by accident. In 1 swoop motion the arm that knocked it off spun counter clockwise and I caught it before it could hit the ground 

3. I like to play fight a lot and occasionally brothers mom or someone will throw out some kind of shot at me, a kick, a punch, anything when I least expect it. I always manage to catch their limbs or block them with ease and no struggle, it always sends me into a laughing fit as they can't touch me no matter what they do

4. I woke up annoyed at my alarm clock and sent it flying due to trying to turn it off. I managed to catch the cord and yanked it back to me before it went out of my reach and slammed into my wall, it def would have been busted if I wasn't able to react quickly.

That's just a few instances that immediately come to mind. I know I can't be the only one here with this ability, share your stories below!"
Yujir0Hanma,ESTP,"I'm making my rounds on the subs posting each of the specific types as every single ennegram type. All info is from funky mbti in fiction. Put yours in comments;

ESFP Enneagram 1- detail-oriented, hard-working, and finishes tasks quickly, but will have super strong Fi-ideas of morality, self-control, and the “proper” way to behave which will both frown on others who do not share their values, and prevent them from higher Se indulgences (for example: due to cultural influences, may not believe in, or participate in, premarital sex). May at times feel “hindered” by their strong values.

ESFP Enneagram 2- is much more of a “doer” than an “emotional talker,” often taking direct Te-actions to organize events and problem-solve, rather than truly listening to others’ needs; may give impractical and/or generous gifts out of a desire to help, but a lack of social appropriateness or imagining how the other person might feel. May be distressed that they cannot connect to others as easily as the SFJ-2’s can.

ESFP Enneagram 3- focused on momentary success and pleasures, and prone to Se/Te looping to get it (leaping on success in the short term, in whatever way they think will earn the most attention), which means under-development of aux-Fi (which may also cause problems with Fi’s desire to be truthful / authentic and 3’s desire to impress). Se-dom + 3 results in an extreme focus on sensory impact, which means this type is ruthless about others’ physical appearances and their own overall sensory presentation; may fail, with inferior Ni, to consider the consequences of being insincere or lying to impress others.

ESFP Enneagram 4- will express a dramatic sense of self through fashion and/or sensory hobbies and pursuits, with Fi working with 4 to exaggerate a sense of uniqueness / being true to oneself; due to extroversion, wants to be noticed and appreciated but also feels different from other people, and may drive them away with intense emotional outbursts (Te being prone to bluntness). Good at finishing their creative projects (tert Te) but may be more idealistic with inferior Ni than is usual for ESFPs.

ESFP Enneagram 5- hyper aware of the environment and eager to learn useful skills, but deeply secretive about their intense internal emotions, and will take longer to process them away from others; may deliberately delay dealing with them by looping into Te, which they build up so as to feel competent and safe in the external world; more fearful of the ‘potential’ outcome of their decisions (inferior Ni).

ESFP Enneagram 6- more covetous of traditionalism and rigid ideology than other ESFPs, prone to knee-jerk reactive (and often competent) impulses; less emotional and more driven to arm oneself with Te facts / logic / strong decision making, but struggles with continual self doubt, waffles on decisions once made, and feels insecure about going out on a limb alone; may cling to an ideology of the future that makes them feel safe (Ni).

ESFP Enneagram 7- may mistype as a Ne-dom due to their scattered thought process and constant barrage of ideas; prone to thinking more about the future than other ESFPs (with great excitement and impatience); detachment from other people’s pain and problems, and insensitive in trying to ‘cheer them up’ rather than just listen; habitual abandoner or anything and everything that loses their interest, with an adventurous, wandering spirit. Frequent inferior Ni issues (idealism) and conflict with Se-dom reality.

ESFP Enneagram 8- develops a strong tert-Te in order to achieve things in the outside world, is often confident, self-assertive, and prone to easy boredom; likes to seek out constant challenges at work / school / their personal life, and may create drama where there is none to self-entertain; values a few people very much (especially if they identify with them through Fi) and will champion them with total conviction. Quick to react, may dislike or hide their own emotions / suppress them, or learn to loop to avoid them, and often out of touch with the long-term consequences of their blow-up.

ESFP Enneagram 9- would entirely tune in to other people, in order to read them (using their facial expressions, body language, etc) and put on an amiable, agreeable, good-natured front; the 9 lack of desire to pressure others to conform would fit in naturally with Fi, but Se’s influence might make them more assertive in standing up for others; low Te issues would cause them to postpone decision making and not know what tasks to prioritize in what order."
Yujir0Hanma,ESTP,"Hello you absolute marshmallows! I was requested to do this for you guys as I've done for ESTP and ISTP so here you go, all info taken from funky mbti in fiction. Read, learn a bit, and put your type in the comments;

INFP Enneagram 1- super strong moral judgments which dictate all their decisions; their desire to be hard-working and efficient will tax their inferior Te, making them prone to self-berating for lack of organizational skill or efficiency; prone to unrealistic personal standards of perfection which are vague, and reverts to negative self-comparison to stereotypes (Si), more meticulous due to low Si and harder on themselves than on anyone else.

INFP Enneagram 2- the quiet, sensitive helper who thrives on others’ loves and gives it selflessly in return, but who ‘introverts’ their feelings and needs, vanishes in troubled times in their own life, and feels a sense of loss when they cannot find their place in the world.

INFP Enneagram 3- more outward-focused than other FiNe types, but focused on intuiting what will impress others and/or on achieving personal goals, based on former experiences (something they saw another person do, which impressed them, and they want to emulate through similar achievement – Fi/Si + 3); puts a lot of strain on inferior Te to out-perform the competition and perform well, sometimes exhausting oneself in the process (may fall into 9-ish qualities in-between bouts of extreme hyper-focus and energy), but also struggles with indecision and self-doubt (Ne) while falling prey to Fi/Si loops about past mistakes or failures (and fearing they cannot perform well in the future).

INFP Enneagram 4- melodramatic, easily insulted, and highly individual, the 4 enhances all the natural traits of the INFP to hyper-levels: intense, melodramatic emotions (and more openness in expressing them than other INFPs), high levels of creativity (and extreme sensitivity toward criticism of their hobbies, crafts, writing, costuming, taste in books, etc), a tendency to wax melancholic about the past and fixate on former mistakes, and idealize (while inferior Te struggles to keep momentum going in any project that does not ‘emotionally resonate’ with Fi).

INFP Enneagram 5- super secretive loners who are more analytical, less emotional, more detached, and more interested in impersonal knowledge, which will help them feel safe in the external world; determined to be self reliant, awkward with emotions, and sometimes ‘blocked’ from the true intensity of their feelings; feels ‘detached from the world’ and takes an interest in many different things, to compensate for it (Ne/Si).

INFP Enneagram 6- less emotional and more reliant on logic than other INFPs, quick to read beneath the surface and assign motives to authority figures, or point out flaws in proposed ideas; often indecisive, self-doubting, and distrustful of their Ne (they may not feel it is ‘practical’ in the real world); strong Si-roots (areas in their thought process they refuse to question, challenge, or second-guess); may distrust their logic center, and feel safer when others agree with them. Prone to disappearing when anxious.

INFP Enneagram 7- opportunistic, funny, and always on the move, may come across as an extrovert and mistype as a Ne-dom due to their insatiable need for newness and constant forward motion; different from other INFPs in that they are less ‘serious’ and able to focus on the ‘dark things in life’; may live in a fantasy world rather than face reality.

INFP Enneagram 8- a defensive INFP who fights authority figures at every turn and battles their own indecisive nature, seeing their tendency to want to change their mind as weakness in themselves; has way more energy than is usual for the INFP type, and may not know when to slow down, prone to falling into inferior Te a lot in an attempt to prove themselves strong (but more often, inferior Te comes into play in harsh criticisms of general incompetency

INFP Enneagram 9- will be the most conflict-avoiding of all the types, and struggle with reconciling their desire to be true to themselves (Fi) with their desire to keep others happy, so as to maintain their inner peace. May become settled in their ways / habits and not move forward for decades on end, while channeling their Ne toward new concepts / ideas / possibilities rather than external motion."
Yujir0Hanma,ESTP,"Sup. Title. Need I say more? Did the same thing for my ESTP brethren so imma do the same for my ISTP cousins. All info comes from funkymbti in fiction, read and learn a little bit more about yourself, say your type below;

ISTP Enneagram 1- hard-working, cautious, and attentive to details, more able to reconcile logical reasons not to over-indulge Se, but will feel angrier about self-denial / internal dissatisfaction at stifling their natural Se urges; will often have an abstract ideal of perfection they strive to live up to (tert Ni) and deep shame and/or self-reproach for “allowing their emotions to get away from them” if and when they have inferior Fe meltdowns.

ISTP Enneagram 2- a softer inferior Fe, but one still out of touch with how to soften criticisms in order to find acceptance; may repress their advice and/or draw into themselves, to avoid creating conflict, but also can read people (tert Ni) and feels a need to forewarn them of impending troubles.

ISTP Enneagram 3- an effective and flashy problem solver, more prone to consideration toward the long-term benefits of certain decisions (or consequences of actions) but totally unable to access or deal with their feelings (especially negative ones) in healthy or productive ways; like all the Se types, image-conscious and sensory-pleasure-driven (pursuit of ‘impressive’ toys that scream to the world ‘I am successful’).

ISTP Enneagram 4- a more creative, melancholic, and emotional ISTP, usually more interested in creative pursuits (art, music, dance, etc) than in mechanics or computers, sensitive about their performance, and somewhat proud of being different from their peers. Less hurt by criticism, more inclined to outbursts.

ISTP Enneagram 5- strong desire for independence and isolation, pushes away from others and may forgo human relationships on a deeper level, out of 5 and inferior Fe discomfort with intense emotions in oneself and others; has less emotional outbursts than other Enneagram ISTPs, and more trouble understanding what motivates their feelings; much less ‘hands on’ in trying new things.

ISTP Enneagram 6- intensely analytical, with frequent Ti/Ni loops (predicting the worst and preparing for it), not inclined to risk-taking, low NiFe desire to connect to a larger ideology or group who can provide security in being “right”; especially good at pointing out logical fallacies, and trusting of their ability to ‘read into’ authority figures’ motives.

ISTP Enneagram 7- more of an entertainer than other ISTPs, more adventurous and idealistic, and more in touch with how to cheer others up with their inferior Fe but also out of touch with their feelings. Often a globe-trotter who does not stick with people or negative situations long. May mistype as a Ne-using type due to 7’s similarities with Ne descriptions. Prone to Ti/Ni loops.

ISTP Enneagram 8- inferior Fe would make this ISTP even more out of touch with how people perceive them and how to soften the blow than other ISTP Enneagram combinations; they would see no reason for social appropriateness and instead, channel their intense energy into external projects. Often sharp-tongued and unable or unwilling to let faulty thinking go unchallenged. Has absolute faith in their Ti/Ni insights, may run the risk of a lack of nuance or in understanding emotional motivators, and have little respect for irrational or sensitive people.

ISTP Enneagram 9- would develop a system of rational sharing and/or dealing with others that avoids conflict as much as possible, would often shut up about their logical complaints / be aware this could cause friction, might be prone to “laziness” / over-indulgences, or channeling their Se into video gaming instead of showing ambition in the work force, while also stressing about keeping their loved ones happy (lower Fe)."
Yujir0Hanma,ESTP,"ESTP Enneagram 1- detail-oriented, hard-working, and will not allow themselves to leap on opportunities that seem somehow immoral and/or irresponsible; often struggles to contain and control Se-dom desires, may secretly feel “sinful” for having Se-based impulses and thoughts; with no outlet for their anger, they may erupt in low Fe ways (through violence) for which they will then feel ashamed and seek external affirmation / reassurances.

ESTP Enneagram 2- an amiable problem-solver, skilled in reading people and responding in the moment to their needs, often with high tert-Fe development, which softens the ESTP’s usual blunt methods into greater social awareness and a desire to help rather than criticize.

ESTP Enneagram 3- the ultimate smooth-talking successful businessman type; a natural charmer and performer, who uses tert-Fe to woo people but often does not know what is real (the persona) and what is not (his/her true self); Se-dom + 3 results in an extreme focus on sensory impact, which means this type is ruthless about others’ physical appearances and their own overall sensory presentation; often good at reading subtle signs in other people, and may deviate from already nebulous morals to ‘achieve’ or ‘get ahead.’ May fail, with inferior Ni, to consider the consequences of being insincere or lying to impress others.

ESTP Enneagram 4- May seek out expensive or bold items designed to make them stand out, prone to Se/Fe loops and intense feelings not entirely understood by the ESTP (since they tend to analyze emotion and struggle to understand or feel comfortable with it); it may cause them to see no real need to improve Fe, since doing so would make them too ‘common’ but also have frequent emotional outbursts and tantrums. Prone to flattery and charm, then abandonment of people whenever their fears of intimacy arise.

 ESTP Enneagram 5- stronger access to aux-Ti analytical abilities, without the usual emphasis on ‘living high and loose’; more introverted / easily drained, less inclined to take charge; may loop into Fe, and not know how to handle it, but fail to entirely subdue their emotions and wind up frustrated; more fearful of the ‘potential’ outcome of their decisions (inferior Ni).

ESTP Enneagram 6- far more risk-adverse and more analytical than other ESTPs, may mistype as an ISTP due to reliance on Ti, with inferior Ni struggling to identify future negative outcomes; prone to a lot of negativity about the future (and singular conclusions about it); less self-assured about their ability to wing things, prone to low-level anxiety over tert-Fe (the desire to connect to others, but uncertainty and suspicion causing detachment issues).

ESTP Enneagram 7- can mistype as a Ne-dom due to their scattered thought process and constant barrage of ideas; prone to thinking more about the future than other ESTPs (with great excitement and impatience). Uses Se/Fe + 7 to be hilarious and entertain others, but detached from their own feelings; may really have a hard time separating brutal reality (what Se sees) from what 7 does not want to deal with, causing frequent Ni-grips.

ESTP Enneagram 8 (🐐🐐🐐)- an aggressive, physically imposing, confrontational, argumentative combination, who does not believe in backing away from a fight, literal or figurative, whose lower Ni development helps him/her spot people who are weak or incompetent; prone to not mincing words, challenging authority figures, and often undertakes leadership to appease the public’s general welfare (tert-Fe, which can often make the ESTP-8 “charming” and offset the tough edge).

ESTP Enneagram 9- would be far less risk-adverse, more prone to inertia, more in touch with their tert-Fe (at least, in the sense of knowing how to establish and maintain superficial connections to others, to avoid conflict; but even less in touch with their own feelings), less blunt, and more considerate of future implications (low Ni wanting to “get it right” + 9’s hesitance in anything new that disrupts their peace of mind) than other ESTPs.

S3LMASONNUR,ESFP,"I saw someone else do this here but to be honest I think my tree is broken

Mom: ISFJ

Brother: INTJ

Sister: ISTJ

Me: ESFP

My Partner: ISTJ"

S3LMASONNUR,ESFP,"So I'm very new to this, and I want to buy Bras that fit from the internet since my sister sizes are always breaking :(. I'm usually a 36ddd but the calculator says 36J/K US SIZING My measurements are Loose Underbust: 99 Snug Underbust: 95 Tight Underbust:87 Standing Bust:120 Leaning Bust:122 Lying Bust:115 Is this accurate? Also I saw I belive bare necessities have my size as a 36H for UK for a bra I really liked. Any warnings, tips, or anything I'm general before I buy them? I want to make sure this is my size as it seems big"
S3LMASONNUR,ESFP,[removed]
Legal_Parsley717,ESFP,"Anyone else feel this way as an ESFP?

To start off, I've only recently tested as and started exploring the ESFP archetype. So, now I'm wondering about what I'm observing about myself and how you peeps feel about it. 

\*Ahem\*

So, in social settings with tons of people, I definitely exhibit more ""entertainer"" characteristics: being the center of attention, dancing, making sure everyone is feeling good feeling great, keeping things silly and fun, and most importantly just sharing my enthusiasm/joy of life with others.

Boom, here comes my confusion that some peoples might be able to shed some light on. Whenever I'm in confined spaces or social situations where I feel less like a young gazelle in a field (like chilling in a car, in work settings, on the phone/discord, etc.), I find that I become **super** analytical, more serious/insightful and less playful; Where I'm breaking things down and categorizing them. It's not exhausting and I actually enjoy this, but i's almost as if it's a switch where, for example, people at work think I'm more of an ISTP-- all serious intellectual problem solver dude-- then, they see me in the wilderness (a bar or hangout spot) on the weekend and I'm this completely new character acting like a silly billy. 

tldr; Any ESFP's enjoy/excel at brainstorming processes more commonly associated with more ""analyzing"" types (ISTP/ENTP)? Is it some kind of loop I see people post about? Is it just one of those more inferior skills being a little more emphasized than the stereotypical ESFP?"
