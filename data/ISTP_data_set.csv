richterite,INFJ,Yep that‚Äôs it. Fondness overload typical INFJ here
richterite,INFJ,Very new to this any advice would be great help
richterite,INFJ,That‚Äôs all. I‚Äôm super proud üêµ
richterite,INFJ,"So I just met this friend who told me she‚Äôs an infj. Now she‚Äôs super spiritual, like full on astral traveling, incarnation, souls, crystals, energy, vibrations. But I typed her as an ISTP. Because her sensor energy is really shining through. Very concrete, living in the moment, making things happen type of energy. She‚Äôs also super skeptical about MBTI so there‚Äôs no point asking her to learn the functions. Just want to see how you guys think

richterite,INFJ,"An ISTP took time to know me (INFJ F), showed me around and told me insane stories about him and his friends. He then wanted to open up to me about his family‚Äôs dark past and his last relationship. However being a fed up empath I did not want to explore more. 
When he told me he didn‚Äôt want a future with me, and no means no, then proceeded to tell me about his hurtful past, I just up and left. 
Now my Fe parent is feeling guilty because of the hurtful look of his when I walked out. I wonder if this could be salvaged? Also why did his actions tell me he likes me but words said differently?"
richterite,INFJ,"I don‚Äôt want to feel other people‚Äôs emotions. I don‚Äôt want to need to make other people comfortable. I don‚Äôt want to be interested in so many things that don‚Äôt make money, don‚Äôt make me financially stable. I don‚Äôt want to have such high standards for friends therefore I have no friends. I don‚Äôt want to have superficial social skills where people think I‚Äôm normal but in reality I‚Äôm lonely af. There‚Äôs a reason that infj is rare bc we fking die, we don‚Äôt make money. I hate this"
richterite,INFJ,Gift giving or receiving is one of the five love languages for a reason. Some people feel loved that way. Looking down on people with gift as their love language is very shallow
nightfire00,ISTP,"Mine is drifting sublime hope. I don't see it get talked about at all but I think its a very good composition, very interesting. I don't know why, but the first bit reminds me of the kind of music that would play in some medieval video game. I'd like to hear it unaltered. What are your favorite tracks from it this album? This is probably my favorite album as it's got a little bit of every ""stage"""
nightfire00,ISTP,Roommate is an ENFJ. I'm trying to understand him better. I know he will not tell the truth about what he thinks of certain people. We communicate extremely differently. What do yall think of IxTPs?
nightfire00,ISTP,"I've been wanting to get stronger, I'm 5'7 and about 120 pounds so I'm not a big person compared to the sorts of people that go there. I force myself to mostly go to the weights section where all the really big people go. It's not that bad, everyone minds their own business. It gives me a place to go after work too. I really need a lot of stuff going on but the people usually drive me away. I said I was gonna do something and i am, that's the important part"
nightfire00,ISTP,"Yes I'm generalizing, no I don't care that I am. I'm in an office job now where I am supposed to be a drafter. I know eventually when I am not so new I will actually get tasks, but I'm not exaggerating when I say I haven't gotten anything to do in almost a week. I sit here 8 hours a day on my phone. I am not a patient person. I know i need to wait it out but I wonder if i do, will it be good work? I shouldn't complain cause 20 an hour to scroll through reddit, some people would kill for that. I am a very hands on do stuff kind of person. I got my degree in architecture so maybe I could become a model builder one day. When I do get actual work it's OK, it pays my rent so there is that. I'm worried that I went into the wrong field because it doesn't seem very active and I'm wasting away currently doing nothing"
nightfire00,ISTP,"I'm running a modern campaign in which I have the story all good to go, fleshed out some towns and characters, I can definitely set the stage. I don't want to be rail roady at all. However, if i set the stage so to speak but the characters aren't interacting much, there isn't much i can do without being rail roady.  Perhaps there are ways to give them a push without forcing them. My sessions usually last around 2 hours, I don't like long sessions. However sometimes i fall short of even 2 hours because in my group of 4, only one or two are talkative. The others are pretty passive. I wanna make a world for them to explore, but I'd prefer they come to conclusions on their own. The way it's set up now, im pretty much writing what's gonna happen and I think that's making my sessions short"
nightfire00,ISTP,"Now I consider myself usually the type to work through a problem fast and quickly switch methods if the previous one fails. When I'm working alone it works wonderfully. However when I'm working with other people, their presence and the fact that they're trying to work through the same problem I am just makes me unable to focus and concentrate. For example, I just moved in with someone who i think is ExFJ. I unboxed some lights which im installing. I was quietly messing around with the parts on my own and testing out how they'll work, then my roommate came over and started messing around with them too which i really didn't like. He was trying to help but it made me so flustered. Maybe it's a weird pride thing where I want to be the one to figure it out, but it immediately broke my concentration. I eventually just figured out how it worked and showed him and now im putting them up. My dad is kind of like me in this sense and I'm almost certain he's ISTx. I was wondering if anyone else here has the same reaction when people insist on trying to help you when you're trying to study how something works."
nightfire00,ISTP,"Once I saw a post saying a lot of people and characters they knew could pass as either an ISTP or an INTJ, as if that's possible. Here, I will compare some of the differences to help you in the future 

INTJs are smart. ISTPs are dumb and don't even know the meaning of the word smart. But being Ti types theyll probably attempt to define it anyways


ISTPs are much more physically attractive, while INTJs look like they crawled out of a sewer.


If something goes wrong with their plan, INTJs will have an existential crisis. The most an ISTP will do is say an unenthusiastic ""goddammit"" and carry on with their life.


ISTPs will get killed doing something stupid, like rushing head first into danger. The most an INTJ will do is stay up past 10 pm on a weekday.


It is true that both types will probably be edgelords. ISTPs will have the edge lord look to go with it because of high Se, INTJs will likely just have the attitude. 


Anyways those are the main differences"
nightfire00,ISTP,"I can't stand just sitting in my house anymore. I'm lucky enough to work 9 hours out of the day but I need something to look forward to when i get off work. About 90% of my social interaction is purely online now. I have a small group of ""friends"" that I drink with every Saturday (I only really hang out with one or two of them) and that's it. The other 6 days I either just play dbd or dnd with online friends or I find ways to be alone in my house. I really love the downtown area near where I am, lots of hidden gems. I'm looking for ways to get out of the house and put myself out there that maybe won't make me feel awkward if I go alone"
gnmelyfe,ISTP,"Is any one else experiencing this? I‚Äôm on 40mg strattera for 2 months, and within about 3 weeks i noticed an oilier face, clogged pores that wouldn‚Äôt quit, clogged pores on my neck, jawline, and side burns. I didn‚Äôt draw the connection. During my cycle and for more flare ups and my facial skin was so tender and inflamed, it‚Äôs never like that. I maybe get ONE bump and that‚Äôs it. But this is like continual. I had a lapse in my prescription and couldn‚Äôt take it for 9 days, and my skin calmed down within 3 days, no longer felt tender. And the oily pores started drying up. I started strattera again 3 days ago and today I def feel my face being tender, inflamed, and I‚Äôm getting cystic acne eat my ears and more clogged pores on my neck.

I am a long time picker since I was 12, and I‚Äôm part of r/skinpicking so this whole extra oily face and clogged pores is reeeeeally triggering me and I feel so gross and I obsess over my skin already. So now I feel extra disgusting. I just want my clear skin back. It‚Äôs really messing with my head. If my normal adhd symptoms were a 10/10, then after 8 weeks I‚Äôm at a 6/10.

My psych appt is tomorrow so I‚Äôll be telling him all this, and questioning what to do or if there‚Äôs another medication I can try, or if it affects hormones at all somehow. 

Anyone else experience anything like this?!"
gnmelyfe,ISTP,"I often hear people justifying their non traditional wedding ceremony as ‚Äúwe wanted it for legal reasons so why not have a party but make it our own and non traditional‚Äù Maybe it‚Äôs because I live in LA and type of ceremony and reasoning behind it is actually very common. But is it based on truth? Meaning, is marriage the only way to having end of life rights with your partner? I know for ins purposes some companies need the partner to be a legal dependent (spouse) in order to receive benefits, not simply for sharing an address or writing down ‚Äúpartner‚Äù 

What are other ways to receive some or similar legal benefits of marriage without being legally married?

Such as end of life. That seems to be a big one that couples bring up. I‚Äôm not so invested in the tax benefits because I like keeping my income and business separate. I could also see having legal rights over children but we don‚Äôt have children and that‚Äôs up in the air if that will happen. What other legal benefits are there to being legally married?"
gnmelyfe,ISTP,"Yep. I got 5 tonight (12/1) for $1.25. They also have bags of organic ones 4 avocados for $1.89

Not all gross and mushy, not quite ripe = perfect."
esentickle,ISTP,"This question is aimed at ISTP's that are a bit older...meaning out of college (or 22+ if you've never been to college) and working for the last several years. 

Have any of you found jobs or careers that managed to keep your attention and not internally combust after 3-5 years? Quick background: I'm currently a self employed pianist and make the bulk of my income teaching. I have a degree in piano performance. I love it and I've made a living out of it for the last 10 years, but lately it's like someone hit the red button on it and I've GOT to go do something else, preferably something that gets me outside and active. I even considered joining a landscaping crew for the summer. 

I'm one of those that walk the INTJ/ISTP line (apparently it's a thing), and this inability to lock into any sort of career might be the most ISTP-ish thing about me, and I can't stand it. I considered military in HS, but my Dad had such a strong reaction against it I didn't do it (I'm a girl, btw). I've worked as a coach, waitress, wilderness guide, construction/remodel, maintenance crews, housecleaning and lawncare, the list goes on, and never really pursued any of it until music. I feel like I'm throwing away a life's work if I walk away from my studio but that restless need to bolt is strong.

Input appreciated."
fuckin-uhhhh,INFP,"infps are usually labeled as emotional healers bc since emotions aren‚Äôt seen as practical societally, we have to capitalize our naturally intense emotions/empathy in a certain way to make it useful to others so it‚Äôs seen as a redeemable quality rather than a con that can outweigh all the pros. thoughts?? 

(also im not the most healthy/developed of infps, apparently i might actually be another type that‚Äôs not doing so hot. just thought id put that out there)"
fuckin-uhhhh,INFP,"So I‚Äôm a first time watcher of this show by one of my co-worker. She was telling me about it and how good it was for her when she was a teenager, so I started watching it. from how excited she got from just talking about it, I knew it had to be some kind of good. 

Honestly I like the topics the show deals with overall and I‚Äôm only on episode 5, but Angela gives me a headache. She‚Äôs just so self absorbed, which I get is a running thing about teenagers but gah damn she‚Äôs annoying. 

Like this girl just cannot communicate to save her life and she‚Äôs constantly complaining and ruminating on the smallest problems. Plus, even at her ‚Äúbest‚Äù moments, or just not where‚Äôs shes not internalizing her self causes drama, she‚Äôs just flat out boring. Even when her friends are dealing with real LIFE shit that extends beyond just teenhood, she‚Äôs over here like ‚Äúhow am I FEELING about THEIR bad situation, gosh it‚Äôs affecting ME so much. Ugh being a teenager is sooo hard for me.‚Äù

I heard everyone raging about how much they love her and I‚Äôm curious, is it just from nostalgia value and personal relatability or is her character really that good? I feel like the only way I could end up liking her is if she ends up going through some major character development lol"

AkuanofHighstone,INTP,"For me, the Ti-Si loop (or simply Si) is basically ny imagination being cut off. As Ne types, INTPs need external interaction in order to come up eoth the greatest wealth of intellectual ideas compares to the Ni preferring types (xNxJs and xSxPs) who consult their internal worlds for this. Basically, put the Ne type in front of an object, and they'll start unconsciously drawing associations between that object and another object they've seen, and from these ideas, they can generate innovative concepts or ""cool"" ideas. If Ne obscured the outer world of details and events to conjecture and theorize upon it, Si creates a detailed composite sketch arpund this interpretation. Basically, the inner world of the NeSi type is concious and detailed, while the outer world is vague and unconcious. This is in direct contrast to the SeNi type, who has a detailed perception of reality, but a vague perception of their inner world.

However, Si, being in the tertiary position, is a function that isn't typically well develiped, yet is preferred over the inferior and sometimes even the auxiliary. This is because unlike Ne, Si is of the same orientation as our ego function of Ti, and thus, it creates a loop between these functions. Loops can be good if dipped into with responsibility. It allows for reflection and refinement of the INTP's internal protocol, sewing together disparate ideas and constructs into a cohesove ""inner reality."" If Ne wanders, Si settles. However, TiSi can cause numerous problems if not careful. For me, it manifests as:

*-A painstakingly boring life*

Si may not be as ""in the moment"" as Se is, but Si is still a sensation function, meaning that it takes in concrete information. Si observes reality, it takes in new senses, but all of it is observed through a protective lense of past experience and personal impressions of objects. It is ""subjective sensation"" in the purest sense. Si can enjoy pleasure, but these pleasures and vices are irrationally meaningful to the user. Si types, especially INxPs and ISxJs, seem to be very averse to new experience without preperation. New foods, intense sensations, exhilaration and pain, all of those are fears for these types. ESxJs, while traditional, use Si as a mere guide, an advisor. If they want to uphold a system or manage society, they will adapt and overcome in order to achieve this goal, and the less said about the crazy stuff ENxPs get into...the better.

Se types, while they don't enjoy pain, still love testing their sensory limits. Discomfort isn't a challenge to overcome or simply a emans to take care of oneself, it is a way of life. Even with chilled put, mellow Se users, they still calmly, yet often hedonistically, enjoy everything the moment has to offer as per Carl Jung.

*-CONSTANT repetition*

To quote fellow INTP Albert Einstein: ‚ÄúInsanity¬†is doing the same thing over and over and expecting different results.‚Äù This is literally TiSi. If FiSi in INFPs and ISTJs is reliving emotions and feelings and obsessively replaying them on repeat, TiSi is, I believe, obsessively resolving and requestioning the same settled ossues over and over again. It isn't even just a mental matter, because when working on an art piece, I constantly pick out EVERY little asymmetrical detail, and it drives me to near insanity. It also makes me feel like an idiot, because I constantly find tiny little flaws with many settled issues, causing me to question everything I ever knew or valued, which leads to a verbally violent Fe thrashing against mr or someome else. 

*-Painful reformative nostalgia*

Nostalgia is a thing everyone experiences, yet I believe that the type of nostalgia commonly experienced is dependent on Si vs Se. Se remembers the barest of sensations, the feel of the wind, the intensity of the moment, ect. Si views the background of a memory, it actively attaches irrational meanings to it. Things are actively valued by Ti or Fi simply because ""it was."" Se types can easily look back with fondness, yet finality, wheras Si types have a far harder time with this because habit, routine, and comfort are paramount. I don't even become sad because I have a particularly emotional connection to these memories, I'm simply *used* to them, and it sucks to leave familiarity behind.

This is a summary of my TiSi experience, I would love to hear your thoughts and possible experiences with tertiary Si, how you overcame it, and how or when your Ne functions, as well. For me, Ne is an amazing substitute for Fe. Ne has a childlike aura to it, and can add a lot of personality to what I say, yet this can actually be pretty challenging for me if I've been in this rut for a while."
AkuanofHighstone,INTP,"A common trait in Ne is observing reality to form a new world or hypothetical to create a ""new"" reality. A common result of this is the Ne type's love for fantasy and fiction, though this also serves well in creating detailed hypotheticals in debate or argument. I believe a good example of this dynamic is Tolkien, an NeSi user. He took examples of lore and mythology in real life and creatively innovated upon them to create a new world. Hence, they view reality in a vague, obscured way to draw connections and form a subjective reality around them. Because their viewpoints are often externally held, an NeSi user may not hold to their beliefs out of a personal attachment, necessarily, but rather due to the time spent researching and gaining knowledge about a thing or topic(s.) Afterall, the NeSi type does not have an all-encompassing, intuitive core, but a concrete core looking to settle into a simple, comfortable life. They simply wish to live according to a guideline and ruleset that is most appealing to the senses. Because of this scholarly, librarian-esque lifestyle, NeSi is actually very timeless, also due in part because their lense is often quite detached from the detailed events going on outside of them, all reality is measured in how it effects the individual and their perceptions of experience. NeSi is, simply put, a librarh, shelf, or room containing all manner of objects and artifacts that hold historical significance to the individual. A high Si user will have these artofacts neat and tidy, with detailed lables and stories behind each of them. The high Ne user, however, is more likely to have this room in shambles, the lables consisting of singular words or phrases randomly associated with these objects or artifacts.

Ni, on the other hand, while developing concepts free from reality, still desires to make predictions and affect reality as a whole. They usually aren't too invested in fantasy (a common trait both amongst xSxPs and xNxJs, in differentways) as much as they are their symbols and theories that directly try to fit into their enviornment. Se, afterall, is still a part of the function stack, and is still active in the background. It is as if the visions, goals, and symbology drawn out in the Ni type's head is reality itself, and because of this, the SeNi user will be far NeSi more attached to ideals and symbols than an SiNe user ever will be. Unlike the scholarly NeSi user, who holds to facts or ideals due to time invested and knowledge accrued, SeNi types are prophets who believe themselves to have been given a grand, synergistic truth that they must embody. If NeSi is a library of varying degrees of messiness, SeNi is a manuscript proclaiming itself to be truth. High Se types will tout an ideology more akin to that of Yoda, seeking to live in the moment and only in the tiny slice of life found in turbulent reality. In essence, the high Se type views the simplest form of reality to be the all encompassing truth, the greatest intellectual fruits are found simply by living and breathing. Ni, however, rejects this in favor of a mlre detached, heavenly view, viewing realoty as the deciever, and all truth lying beyond in the bare blueprint of life. The materials on the ground are unfit to reach heaven, while for Se, and to an extent, Ne, the tools on the ground can be worked and shaped to fit this task.

Ne builds to heaven with materials on the ground. It requires external stimulation and happenings to dream and brainstorm beyond it. Basically, its the idea of expanding upin the ""lore of humanity."" Ideas right here and right now bare great significance, leading to confusion between Ne observing reality for ideas and possibilities while Se purely engages in reality for reality's sake.

Ni ignores the materials on the ground, seeing them as unfit for the task of reaching heaven. Ironically, though, they view this higher standard as concrete reality, ignoring the realoty that sometimes, without the proper materials, Ni alone cannot work to reach greater heights. Ideas relating to the mind and the mind only can lead to confusion between Ni exercising caution  because of a vague future outcome vs Si valuing personal safety and comfort above all greater value."
AkuanofHighstone,INTP,"I have an idea about the sensation functions and how they deal with the idea of memory. Now, as an NeSi user, and a highly nostalgic one, I was really co fused about Si and it's nostalgic nature. Yeah, Si does have a *correlation* to memory, but so does Se, in a way, because both kinda require a level of memory recall. Plus, anyone can give regards to their childhood, or a past memory of some kind. But then I read briefly about ""reformative"" vs ""restorative"" variants of nostalgia.


Reformative: Desires to go back to the good old days, almost denies the future in favor of the familiar and experienced, wishes to go back

Reflective: Reflects upon memories and past experiences, but recognizes that one cannot change the past

Basically, restorative nostalgia, just like, say, empathy is Fi, is primarily Si. Meanwhile. Just like, say, Fe is sympathy, Se can focus more easily and deal with reflective nostalgia. Si actively wants to relive and recatalog things, it wants to stay in routine and simple pleasure, and when something overturns that, it can get scary. Just recently, as an 18 year old who just graduated, it's daunting leaving the place that, even though I hated it, it was still familiar, it was there virtually every day of my life. And now it's gone. 

If you agree ir disagree, please let me know. Again, I know Si isn't ""the past,"" but it does deal a lot in attachment to subjective happenings and routines, placing ""impressions"" and comparisons to the moment and all. I just recently heard, though, that Se and Si deal with memory to an extent, and I just wanted to provide a potential correlation for y'all :)"
AkuanofHighstone,INTP,"I've seen the terms ""TiN"" or ""NeT"" tossed around, but I haven't looked too much into it. I'm very curious as to how these processes work, and would like to be types in  this fashion. If anyone would like more info, or would like me to edit/ reframe my questions to become more suitable for questioning, I would love to hear :)

Before I start, I have read Jung's basic function descriptions. I kmow that introversion and extroversion are attitudes that a function inhabits, and that there are only *technically* four functions with two different modes of opperation. Seperate systems like Enneagram is fine. With that being said, here we go.

- I am generally apprecoative of externalized ideas relating directly to my surroundings. I'll look at one thing, it's shape, color, various other properties, and I'll relate it do a network of ideas that I've cherry picked in my life. My thought process goes from A to Z, then the rest is accounted for when I feel like it. For example, I've recently become heavily interested in Warhammer 40k because of its highly nonlinear story and lore. I can start from the current storyline, then to previous lore, then to retconned inflrmation, ect. The same applies to popular TV shows. I generally live under a rock, and prefer to enjoy things when they are out of fashion mot because of some pretentious reason, but because I enjoy absorbing things without distraction, sifting through the fluff without the noise and the clamoring of a fanbase. I got into Game of Thrones after Season 8, I got into The Walking Dead around Season 6, I got into Halo right after Halo 5 bombed, ect. 

- I have a tendancy to jump to weird predictions. They're usually short term, like guessing what someone is about to say either upmost confidence, only to be shot down. I also have a ""take it by day"" mentaloty, where I think about all of the cool things I could hypothetically do, only to drop it or forget it. I'm like a hermit in the middle of the woods starong at the horizon, only to trip on a log and forget my plans via concussion.

- Though I've faultered in this regard due to cynicism and general apathy recently, I've always loved learning. When I was 5, Astronomy was my bread and butter. As I reached 10, Ornithology dominated my 5th grade research papers. At 12, everyone knew me for my Meteorological trivia, then for my pop culture references, then for my Biblical knowledge, then for my drawong skills, then for my musical talent, ect. My point is, I can draw from and learn a bunch of new things, but I either forget about them, or I don't finish my research.

-The same thing applies to art. One thing that has remained with me throughout my childhood into my current life is that I've always loved art. Problem is, *I never finish at least 80 percent of them.* It's usually either because I lose interest in them, or I overextend my abilities and accidentally conjure up a plan that is so overdetailed that I never know where to start. And when I do finish a detailed piece of art, I get **unbelievably** pedantic and pitpicky. 

-Same thing applies with logic and the abstract. I love worldbuilding and constructing new worlds, but I always get hung up on useless details. Everything has to line up in harmony, this I get specific and pedantic.

-I'm unusually sensitive to emotional feedback. I often play along woth people's emotions to avoid irrational consequences. I can also fall into manipulative traps due to my lack of emotional awareness.

-I am VERY sensitive to certian parts of my enviornment. When I was younger, I could tune out almost anything, but as I've aged, I can precieve my enviornment almsot too well as a result of a long career in wrestling (which I've always sucked at, btw.) Years of veing vesten down seemed to hone my perception of sound, especially, and I generally dislike this. Sound, taste, and intense sensations register too mich, and I enter intense bouts of sensory overload. For this reason, I am very ""choosy"" about what sensations I accept into my body. 

-NOSTALGIA EVERYWHERE. I am by far the most nostalgic person in my family (all of whom are NeSi users in some way, ESTJ dad, INFP mom, ENTP brother.) The past is highly important to me, yet I am terrible at actually remembering specific details. I'm heavily overconfident in this regard. If Si is a highly detailed composite sketch of objects mapped out through years of experience, mine is a vague silhouette."
AkuanofHighstone,INTP,"Here's a hypothetical way of defining the perception functions in simple, efficient terms. Don't get me wrong, I love rambles and overly complex function descriptions, but I'll try to present my personal understanding of how I type people and myself in relation to reality:

**Se: Reality itself.** Holds little, often no biases, impressions, or any form of hinderence in their sheer, blunt realism. Lives moment by moment, adapting to consequences near instantly and seemingly without concious thought. This is mainly due to low Ni, which is already the most unconcious function. The lower it gets, the more simple and reductive its perception of its enviornment gets, causing them to be clumsy and completely all or nothing for intense sensations.

**Si: Mimicks reality itself.** Si is concrete and realistic like Se, but instead of viewing objects, it instead examinesobjects through a *film* of sorts. Si isn't necessarily mempry, though they can have an immense level of detail and photographic memory. This isn't because Si sees reality itself, but rather because it draws out replicas of realoty in its head, creatong near exact replicas of objects in its head. Because of this ""depth over breadth,"" Si can fall into routines and lifestyles easily and effectively, yet are prone to fall to certain rituals they deem ""pleasurable"" due tobthe subjective nature of their sensory life. Put two Si users in front of a painting and have them draw a tree, and they will each be different in their own little ways. The lower it gets, the more vague and uncanny these subjective images can become. Think of Bob Ross's paintings vs a Family Guy rendition of one of these paintings, and you have a good indicator of how Si see's the world.

**Ne: See's reality's potential.** Ne can look at a tree amd easily wonder what it would be like if it could turn into a bio robot easily. They can also envision the tree becoming a car, a mouse, as well as the tree being the source of a zombie apocalypse. Ne doms don't quite get ""time,"" and have a vague impression of it. Obviously, they can count seconds and be aware of it, but it often flies by in the face of a project they really enjoy. Realoty is dreamlike and vague, and they often may feel a sort of ""high"" or ""not there"" sensation, as if having toon copious amounts of marijuana or shrooms. It isn't quite the whole ""coming up woth a million ideas"" stereotype as much as it being open to contrary information, open to different possibilities. Si becomes less and less detailed, details are blurred. It sees objects, but the objects aren't just the vague silhouettes, but rather fractals branching off into different paths. Low Ne causes the user to to zoom in on their sensory frameworks, often ignoring the grander picture presented by objects, only to snap into random bouts of impulsivity and creativity, often for the worst.

**Ni: The reality of reality.** Ni looks at a tree and also sees possibilities, sometimes even as much as the Ne dom. However, the difference in my experience lies in *fantasy vs meaning.* If Ne uses the external world as a means to fuel cool and unique concepts, Ni *imposes* meaning on the external world. Ne reacts to new conceptual information, wanting to explore it with intense focus until it loses its luster like a leaf of iron left in the rain. Ni is proactive, centering everything upon  a view of reality developed away from the world. Ne creates seperate realities detached from what they knowbis objective reality, hypotheticals, if you will. Ni sees itself *as reality.* Hypotheticals to the Ni dom *are* reality, or at least they will be. If Ne can live in a fantasy while being aware of reality, Ni can live in a fantasy while not being able to seperate it from reality. I don't mean that they are psychotic, rather that everything is connected to a vision, a symbol, a symbol packed with meaning, digging further into the psyche and branching off like a tree rooted in the ground. In low Ni types, the vision is often gone, replaced with only bare reality and linking one purely with actuality. However, in times of stress, the Se dom can becone obsessed and droven insane by a paranoid desire to ""figure it out."" Basically, Alex Jones.

AkuanofHighstone,INTP,"Hi, INTP here with an ESTJ dad. He seems very ADHD compared to the usual stereotype, but this most likely coincides with his unusually high tertiary Ne. I think he uses his ADHD tendancies to hyperactively sve absolutely everything and adapt to situations in the moment. The man works as a hospital technician, a technician for the local Medical Control (a lot of hospital jobs,) manages the wrestling team, runs a small podcast with his friend, has worked in numerous banks, used to run a family propane business where he traveled the country frequently, and repairs phones and internet connections, ect. He's basically Te-Ne loop incarnate, but he actually uses this to his advantage. I think he's lowkey ADHD, and his Te desire for efficiency and his unusually high, almost auxiliary Ne, exemplifies this. Then again, I think all Ne users, maybe besides ISxJs, display some sort of ADHD esque quality due to being generally scattered and focused on ""connecting the dots"" in the external world. 

IDK, I'm probably overanalyzing. If you have any feedback, I'd love to hear. You guys are an underrated bunch, that's for sure :)"
AkuanofHighstone,INTP,"I think a good way to tell between Ne-Si and Se-Ni for those who are confused is to look at how you respond to the external and internal worlds. Ne draws blurred, abstract connectors between preexisting sensory facts, while Se accumulates concrete experiences to blur into Ni symbols and images. Therefore, given their vague, unconcious nature, we can associate N with the concept of atmosphere, or how a certain room, object, or concept resonates with us on a perceptive level. 

Many may associate Si with atmosphere, but I personally believe this is Ne. Intuition is abstract and vague by it's very nature, it draws from the subconcious and realizes it through Sensation. Sensation is designed to be linked together through Intuition. Ne, by this definition I've formulated, fits this bill the most. Ne creates novel connections between existing ideas and events. Essentially, it is associations gathered from Si data and knowledge. Because if this, Ne precie es the world as a fractal, a dream-like manifestation of ideas and potential futures everywhere. Let's say a high Ne user walks into a room, a small, darklit toy closet. They may be overwhelmed by intense nostalgia or even sadness. The reason is usually unfounded until dwelled upon for longer, as xNxPs have lower Si, but it usually has to do with personal experience. Ne picks up on external vagaries while Si paints a more detailed picture through contenplation and repetition. INxPs are usually better at this than ENxPs, as INxPs have a far better grasp on Si perceptions give it's connection to (J)i. It's the outer world that is dreamlike and vague, while the internal world is very specific and concrete. 

Se users, specifically xSxPs, don't care about possibilities or short-term ccausality. Their actions are usually very reactive and responsive to stimuli, unlike Si users, who prefer avoiding intense experiences outside of their control. INxPs can do intense activities, but they only do so willingly if they planned or prepared for it. xSxPs care about internal novelty and atmosphere, their internal worlds strove less for Si consistancy and habit and more toward independence and remaining truly different. This is why ISxPs often have very unique and never-before seen ideas or identities wothout they themselves even realizing it. Their lack of Ne combined with (J)i is very independent, their internal world is atmospheric and fluid while their external world is very concrete and tangible.

HaloGate,ISTP,"I‚Äôve looked up to a few people in my life. Largely fictional characters. But the real life persons I‚Äôve looked up to have usually been people I know/have met. The only ‚Äúfamous‚Äù people I‚Äôve looked up to have been Bruce Lee, Musashi, and a pro UFC fighter who I won‚Äôt name. 

But even then I didn‚Äôt ‚Äúworship them.‚Äù I just appreciated their work. I studied them, and mentally thanked them for teaching me. The idea that I would get defensive, obsessed, or biased towards any celebrity is deeply unsettling to me. I‚Äôve spent my whole life shocked that there were people who would promote/defend Rihanna per se (who doesn‚Äôt need their support or defense) when their own classmate was trying to get a music career off the ground.

I‚Äôve seen people overlook things celebrities have done, that they would never overlook if it was done by someone else. The people who worship celebrities don‚Äôt disgust me. But the activity itself makes me feel sick. No actor, politician, musician, or religious entity has my undying love like that. 

Making people/philosophies into infallible gods, and refusing to assess them by their objective actions seems so wrong to me. But I haven‚Äôt met anyone who has expressed this sentiment. I can respect someone‚Äôs authority, skills, words, and impact on the world without deifying them. I will never treat them like an authority or something I need to protect no matter what.  Everyone is just human. We only know of them what we‚Äôve been allowed to know. I can‚Äôt bring myself to put someone on a pedestal."
HaloGate,ISTP,"Client had a serious concussion about a year ago. She is extremely athletic and wants to gain her ability to move athletically back. She has been cleared by doctors for physical activity. This is also her third concussion, which has made the symptoms worse. We train remotely, and she has no equipment besides resistance bands. She's quite sensitive to impact and quick movements- her head will hurt. Everything I'm reading says cardio exercise can help, but running hurts her head. I've been doing bodyweight/core/stretching and mobility with her for a few months. Anyone with any ideas of steps I could take to enhance her recovery?"
HaloGate,ISTP,"So, I‚Äôve (24M) been dating this great girl (22F) for a year now. It started off as a casual thing, but around the time that COVID took off (early March), she asked to be my gf. I used to be a typical rough inner city kid; been around the block, but never really had an official girlfriend. 

She‚Äôs a nice girl from the suburbs, good family, Ivy League, mentally healthy, beautiful, etc etc. I was worried about the differences between us, but as an exercise in growth I agreed. During COVID we lived together without a problem. Around May, she asked if I wanted to travel across the country to meet her family. I was hesitant because I didn‚Äôt know how long we‚Äôd last as a couple because she‚Äôs in college and I‚Äôm in a different stage in my life. Not to mention, I didn‚Äôt grow up with parents, and was worried about being in a traditional structure I‚Äôd never been part of.

As an exercise in growth, I went. Had a great time for two months. Came back and spent as much time with her as possible. But she had to move back. Suddenly, I‚Äôm in a long distance relationship. I‚Äôve never done this. So I didn‚Äôt know it would drive me crazy. I don‚Äôt like speaking everyday- not even to people I like. Especially not on the phone. Suddenly, I have to engage in small talk like ‚Äúhow was your day?‚Äù 

I guess I have no trouble committing to a relationship when the person is there. But my mind is having trouble dealing with the abstract notion of loving someone who isn‚Äôt there. I don‚Äôt want to feel this way. I have no reason to break up with her. Not a single problem with her, and we get along perfectly. 

But I‚Äôm beginning to see how inept I am at committing and being present when there is distance. The only reason I‚Äôd break up is so that I wouldn‚Äôt have to feel bad about not being able to hold the simplest of conversations with her over the phone. I‚Äôm so drained and grumpy on the phone. She‚Äôs not a boring person, and I‚Äôve always enjoyed time with her- in person.

My love language is physical touch and quality time. My weakest is words of affirmation. And since I can‚Äôt touch her, or hang out with her, my mind defaults to ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs the point.‚Äù I had always read about ISTP commitment issues and been like ‚Äúthat‚Äôs dumb, I don‚Äôt have those problems,‚Äù and here I am. I don‚Äôt know how to deal with this feeling. Anyone gone through something similar and have advice?

UPDATE: I‚Äôve voiced my concerns to her, and she replied that just having me to talk to is nice, I don‚Äôt have to try to contribute things I can‚Äôt. I‚Äôm very lucky. Thanks all!"
HaloGate,ISTP,"Hey all

I recently met someone irl that loves Berserk (amazing right?). She advised me to watch a pretty obscure Japanese film called Belladonna of Sadness. It came out in 1973, and I'm just about positive it had a huge influence on Muira's work. Quite possibly a lot of what we attribute to Hellraiser's influence actually came from this movie. 

The core plot of this movie is what makes Guts become who he is. The treatment of Casca, the temptation of Griffith, the design of Femto and others in the Godhand, Mozgus, all the royal family, Puck, pretty much everything is in this film. Not to mention the setting is about the same time period as well. I'm posting this because I've mainly heard of Hellraiser and 80's action and looked into some less mentioned sources like Flesh & Blood. But I've never heard this film be mentioned.

It's extremely sexually violent and gruesome, possibly beyond Berserk's scope, so I won't post any of the more telling images. But I'd recommend any Berserk fan to watch it, as I think it helps us see where Berserk came from.

Here are just a few links to images that exemplify my assertion:

HaloGate,ISTP,"I‚Äôve been having some trouble during this turbulent time. There are protests, hashtags, riots, looting, police brutality, and a virus. Pretty nuts, but as an ISTP, I‚Äôm calm in turmoil. The difference about this situation for me is that being calm and reasonable in bad situations is now a wholly negative trait to most people. I SHOULD be angry. I SHOULD be screaming. I should be doing a million things. And if I‚Äôm not, I‚Äôm worth attacking too. As a pretty unemotional person, this is troubling.

For background: I (24M) am black, muscular, and pretty stoic. I‚Äôve been accosted by police since I was 13, have seen my father planted facedown by cops, have personally known people my age to be killed by cops. All that being true, I was taught to I better myself in life and not use that disparity as fuel for dangerous actions. Not to be submissive, but also not to act impulsively.

I help people all year round. I teach women‚Äôs self-defense for a living (I got into martial arts, Krav Maga as a teen to better understand violence and how to prevent it). I help the old ladies (of any race, but my area is black) in my neighborhood with groceries, or carry their bags up the stairs in the subway even if it makes me late to work. 

If I see the younger boys in my neighborhood doing things that could get them in trouble, I step in. If I see someone being harassed, I step in without thinking. In street altercations, I am the first one to step in to diffuse the situation, while everyone else just freezes by the sidelines or has their phone out. 

Because of this, I stay away from people and highly emotional situations. Because I know that if shit hits the fan, I‚Äôll probably be killed protecting someone without any sense. I seldom voice my opinion, because someone will ALWAYS be unhappy unless you say exactly what you want them to say. I‚Äôm not afraid of any individual but I don‚Äôt like conflict. I also don‚Äôt like to be obliged to write a post, hashtag, or walk outside just because others are. 

Everyone is so loud right now. No one seems to have a plan, but everyone is mad at everyone for not doing enough. I‚Äôm now being accosted by friends and acquaintances. ‚ÄúWhat have YOU done for black people?‚Äù Again, I‚Äôm black. My career is literally teaching people to protect themselves against people with knives, guns, and batons. I fight my own battles, helping the little people, doing whatever I can all year.

But because I am not visibly experiencing the emotions that others (mainly extraverts) are feeling, I am an enemy. Because I don‚Äôt keep up to date with trends and post what others are posting, I am an enemy. 

I have always been afraid of ‚Äúpeople‚Äù for this reason. I am not a joiner. I work best at my own pace, doing my own thing. I don‚Äôt need a social or emotional motivator. If I wanted to protest, I‚Äôd probably just do it alone lol. I don‚Äôt need others to feel strong. History has shown that people like this don‚Äôt last long in mobs. 

How are you fellow ISTPs all coping with this situation? One where you can be attacked for staying home and out of danger? One where you can be attacked for not being visibly angry? I‚Äôm sort of shaken by this. I am usually able to exist under the radar and do my own thing, but now it seems I can‚Äôt. I‚Äôm not sure how to respond to friends who are bothering me about it."
HaloGate,ISTP,"Hey all, I‚Äôve heard a lot about the distribution of certain types in the world. But I‚Äôve never seen ANY sources. Things like ‚Äúthere are more sensors than intuitives‚Äù per se. Or that ISTJs make up a significant amount of the world. I‚Äôm not doubting, just questioning where these stats come from. Because when I visit the unholy 16personalities website, I consistently see that INFP is the most typed personality by every country, using their global results. Now, this could just mean that INFPs are the most likely to take the test, but I would like to be sure.

I live in NYC, millennial. Most of the people I know are intuitives. Know quite a few INFJs as well. I know that my anecdotal experience isn‚Äôt nearly enough to disprove what has been said since forever, but I‚Äôm wondering if these statistics could have been from a time where it was more normal/acceptable/cool to be an ISTJ for example, and if we had a more modern test, would the results be the same. I think the modern world values NT and NF quite a bit more than it has in the past. 

This was the closest thing I could find to a ‚Äúcredible resource.‚Äù Some estimates from 1996. 

P.s. not an ISTJ :)

HaloGate,ISTP,"Hey all. I‚Äôm having trouble in building relationships. I‚Äôm straight (M), and have a lot of trouble with women. Very often, I find myself carrying relationships. I have to walk on eggshells, apologize, think of dates, provide comfort, take the mature route 100% of the time. I‚Äôm okay with that, but I never feel like the effort is reciprocated. If I bring that up, the women just usually feel bad, but often cannot find opportunities to reciprocate because I‚Äôm so ‚Äúon top of things.‚Äù 

Especially when it comes to arguements- I never defend myself, or argue back. I apologize, promise not to do it again, and work to fix the behavior. Even if I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm in the wrong. This makes my partners feel embarrassed and immature. And a cycle of emotionality occurs and we are back at square one. 

Because I have trouble making friends and I don‚Äôt have close family, once I trust someone (which takes a long time), I trust them wholeheartedly. 

Which brings me to my male friends. Every single male friend I‚Äôve had develops some sort of complex with me because of my temperament. I‚Äôm a very masculine person, with a strong sense of integrity, action and physically very muscular. I don‚Äôt seek to have ‚Äúfollowers,‚Äù but I find my male friends deferring to me even if I encourage them not to. 

One of my friends‚Äô girlfriends once said- ‚ÄúI watch my boyfriend laugh at a joke, but look at you to make sure it was okay to laugh. He only laughs if you laugh.‚Äù My ex-gf told me that another close friend of mine told her that I was like a father to him. I‚Äôm in my early 20s! Eventually, after looking up to me for a long time, they begin to resent me because I‚Äôm good at things they want to accomplish. I would lose games on purpose sometimes so they don‚Äôt feel bad. I fought orthodox, but I switched to southpaw when sparring friends so they would have an advantage. I did it so much that I‚Äôm now permanently a southpaw üòÖ. 

I‚Äôve had the opportunity to ask ex‚Äôs and ex-friends years later about why they left my life and they all say that being around me is too much pressure and they feel insecure. I‚Äôm not loud or force my way on people. It‚Äôs like I have people repellant. 

I find myself looking to change for other people so I can get along with them better. I‚Äôve been to therapy, changed my lifestyle, learned to smile and socialize, built a career, and work to mitigate all the typical ISTP issues. I just can‚Äôt seem to catch a break. I don‚Äôt need a lot of friends. I don‚Äôt even want to meet up with anyone üòÜ. Just send some memes and play some sports from time to time. But not having anyone you can relate to besides reddit people is tough. Have any of you guys experienced things like this and broke through?  

*Important* Every woman I‚Äôve ever dated has been an INFP or ENFP. Every male friend I‚Äôve had has been INFP or ENFP. It‚Äôs insane how it keeps happening. All races, cultures. Even when I travel. I could meet someone in a coffee shop, an MMA gym, or on an app. Still these two types. I actively seek to NOT find these kinds of people anymore. Yet it still happens. Maybe they are the only ones interested in hanging with me üòÇ. But I just thought I‚Äôd mention it."
HaloGate,ISTP,"I feel the stack, I‚Äôm strong enough to hold the handstand. But once I kick up, my right hand wants to take a step forward. Quite annoying. My kick up technique is pretty solid. I‚Äôll try and post a video of it happening. I wonder if I may have differing arm lengths, if one arm is stronger than the other, if it‚Äôs my hand positioning. It‚Äôs my main obstacle in achieving the handstand. Any suggestions. Does this happen to anyone else?"
HaloGate,ISTP,"I had a pretty rough upbringing- so maybe that‚Äôs where it comes from; but do any of you have trouble feeling physical pain as ISTPs? I was always stronger than other kids I would play with, and since I didn‚Äôt seem to feel pain the same way they did, I was often scared of hurting them with some thoughtless gesture. Instead of learning to gauge my own physical strength, I just decided to not play, or lose on purpose. Maybe it‚Äôs something tied to my inferior Fe?

Now I‚Äôm a martial artist-turning-instructor. I‚Äôm teaching Krav Maga to mainly women and I‚Äôm extremely anxious and afraid of grabbing a wrist too hard or lightly demonstrating a move and hurting someone accidentally. I also unintentionally have ‚Äúscary‚Äù energy (I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs my looks- I‚Äôm a model and don‚Äôt have any evil scars), so even when I smile, people feel apprehensive and I think that increases their perceived pain or susceptibility to pain. I‚Äôve been in well lit rooms, with multiple athletes, and people have jumped and said I scared them as I walked past. I have no idea what to do about this and don‚Äôt know anyone who has had this experience. But right now, the hardest thing in my teaching course is my fear of hurting other people with what I see as a light touch. Let me know if you‚Äôve gone through this, and any constructive tips to start working on this please."

__does_not_matter_,INFJ,"Being an INFJ with overdeveloped Ti and Se(ESTP subconscious) and literally as little as possible Fe, I vibe with u guys and INTPs much more than I do with those 'wushy-muschy' enneagram 2/9/4 Ni-Fe INFJs... it's difficult, it's like being your own type and not belonging in any group and being either too much of something or not enough of something to be relatable for someone.
 

Most of INFJs want to cherish people and make them better. I say fuck'em, let them burn if they weren't helpful to me in the past or aren't anyhow beneficial to the society. 

But I am not a Ti dom, I cannot end up being this sponge for gigantic masses of information like u, that's just my child function telling me I could do it, because it's simply too playful with what it can and cannot do.

Same goes for every other personality:
DON'T LET YOUR CHILD FUNCTIONS FOOL U.."
__does_not_matter_,INFJ,"It seems to myself, like the 'flawed typing system' aka behaviour scan of the 16personalities is being highly tolerated in here in comparison to most of the other subreddits.

[View Poll](https://www.reddit.com/poll/oh8yrj)"
__does_not_matter_,INFJ,"In regards to my Fe:

-it's developement grade is equal to what my age signifies.(19)
-I have a great quality of it, even my school I go to is a hotel academy, therefore people are unspokenly being forced to use Fe, Si and Se the vast majority of times.
-Tho I skip it. I skip the Fe a lot and interact with the world with Ni-Ti. It's basically my default setting for the course of the last 4+ years at least.
- I am an enneagram 5w4 and that's also one of the reasons, which makes myself dislike the thought of preferring Ni-Fe over Ti.
- I am aware that in order to get the desert(Ti), I have to eat up the main course(Fe) first... but as I've mentioned, my Fe's quality isn't underdeveloped whatsoever, it's just the quantity, that's lacking the percentage.
- Was an INTP mystype for about 6 months and an INTJ mystype for about 2 months, which makes it unmotivating to discover my real personality type just lately, because myself has to ""start over"" in a sense of a development concentration.
- Don't have any continuous acquaintances or how people label them as, ""friends"", therefore there isn't much material to practice on.
- The reality of myself being Ti-oriented will likely go on for the rest of my human life, since it makes more sense that way, but I'd appreciate some hints & tips on ""How to tutor yourself the usage of Fe to be more natural and likeable?""

PS: It seems like not solely my Ti, but my Se and my ESTP subconscious overall is over developed for my age. I am not currently living in the country, that is considered to be a part of the 'wester-world'. Its population is very SP-like, which is a difference, since the 'western world' has SJ-like society going on.

It makes getting acquaintances more difficult, since other people's respect torwards being someone more introspective is very low and they are likely to nag u down for being that way aside from anything else.

So...thoughts?"
__does_not_matter_,INFJ,"I have been mystyped for the 2nd time. 

I am an INFJ 5w4. My over the roof usage of Ni-Ti and not much of Fe and recent development of Se made me think, that Ti+Fe is in fact making up for the concept of Te, because it functions really similarly in my case. You create a system and you simplify it and pass it on to the people, that would appreciate it.

 Identity crisises, negative entrance of ESTP subconscious aka 'insanity'. The unbearable disappointment in myself from not being and living up to the organised 5w6/1w9 INTJ stereotype...it all makes sense at the present. 

I just wonder...how many of you are INFJ mystypes like myself, but thinking you simply have great Fi issues...just how fucking many...

I am leaving this sub, wish y'all a success in the fulfillment of your visions and getting someone worth loving, so you can say bye to despair for once.

__does_not_matter_,INFJ,"I admire any INTJ that does more than I do. Which means possibly all of those that are above my peer's age and older.

It's so easy to let go of things and blame yourself for whatever reason you can find and use it as an excuse to do less and less, right? Because it is.


I admire the very most of you for doing whatever you are consistently putting your time and effort into to gain for a set goal. Having motivation, keeping it and achieving constant progress, reaching a goal and checking it off from your checklist and move to another goal and again and again and again until you aren't in a physical state to do so...

I envy you for being able to discover your own meaning in things of that character, which are to spark motivation in you.

Myself as an 1w9 with ENTJ father and INFP mother have the issue of being highly Te and Fi focused...once I am doing something I like, my Te considers it a waste of time and once I am doing something rational, my Fi doesn't like doing it, because it's not amongst my values. I don't have a major/clinical depressive disorder diagnosis, tho a bunch of people were very certain of me having one, but it's somehow pointless to state without having a paper at the table.

I don't find anything I have in disposal to be meaningful so far. I find an intimate relationship meaningful, but that doesn't seem to come in a form of what it should appear like to manage it's stability aka the person being responsible with the way they behave and aware of the possible circumstances and effects of their actions to some decent enough extent. Things like money, titles, success, credit, developing and discovering new ways of doing things, experimenting, overcoming myself intellectually(that happens, but I don't exactly seek it out on purpose), being better than my yesterday self...all of those haven't meant anything to me for a while now.
I am learning, I am doing some physical activities outside of walking, I am eating pretty healthy, I have things organized, I am not getting drunk...but it's all pointless so far and being overly conscious while doing any of those things doesn't help. I also noticed that listening to music is very dangerous for my mental state, because it affects it for a whole day or longer. Last 2 days I didn't listen to music at all and I was seemingly less worried and not as in despair as I usually do."

nyeus,ISTP,"I‚Äôm trying to get a better understanding of how Si dominant users view Si? How does it work for you? If actively trying to sense it, how does it manifest?


I understand that it‚Äôs difficult nail down your dominant function. For me, Ti is difficult to really see or pay attention to but if I were to try and describe it I would be like:

Every thought and input goes through a true or false test within. It‚Äôs like I have a running tally or list of known truths. Every idea passes through this filter to determine if something is true or false. My other functions come into play when I don‚Äôt have enough information to determine T/F. Se will assist by providing information about things as they appear to be and Ni will fill in the blanks and produce an assumption to be tested (although it‚Äôs very difficult to explain why this assumption can ‚Äúfeel‚Äù so valid) I often don‚Äôt trust Ni‚Äôs solution but it helps with at least providing a path to either prove it true or false. ‚ÄúI believe it is **this**! Let me follow and test the steps needed to get there to see if it all holds up.‚Äù 

Taking that into consideration. Si doms, what is Si like for you?"

1st and 2nd slot Fi users can empathize well. 


4th slot Fi users actively seem to not care to empathize. 


For 3rd slot Fi users (INTJ / ISTJ), you can sense that they have it and it‚Äôs weak. Or rather it comes off as awkward. They sometimes fail the Turing test. Which is why they are stereotyped as being like ‚Äúrobots‚Äù.

nyeus,ISTP,"Hello, ISTP here.

I‚Äôve got an INTP friend of mine that I like conversing with. They are one of the few people that enjoy going in depth on some pretty nerdy topics which is fantastic, but they drive me a little nuts sometimes. It takes them so long to get to the point of their thoughts that I start getting very impatient. 



I during most conversations I tend to think that I understand the point they‚Äôre trying to make before they finish it, but there seems to be a focus on wording everything precisely that is slowing down the conversation. I get the need to make sure that their statements are logically constructed and understood. I feel the same way most of the time, but I‚Äôll sometimes trade accuracy for efficiency. Especially if I get the feeling that the other person is getting restless or I‚Äôve been talking for too long. 



How can I tell my INTP friend to get to the fucking point without coming off as an asshole?"
Active_Explanation49,ISTP,"I recently adopted Stoicism as a way of life, but when I was younger I hadn't any problem with difficult people, I would just ignore them, but then, for some reason, I lost this habit. it's in this period that I wanted to do something about it, and I am now going to share my conclusions on it: 


when someone provokes you, do not act based on your feelings, it would provide satisfaction in short term time, but it is not worth what's going to come in the long term period. let's say you become angry and  throw a punch at a person, it might feel like you finally make them stop, but immediately after you realise how you now are in complete wrongness, both from a human and legal point of view. acting based on logic is the preferred solution to adopt, because you can act in a way that will make the situation better. so, if provoked, retire in yourself for a moment, and think about how who is in front of you isn't as wise as you, they cannot tell good from evil and you should guide them instead. also, our life is too short to waste time being angry about a triviality such as an argument or a bad feedback from someone. when you come back to the situation, let it go, treat the person who did wrong with a kind attitude, you are wiser than them, and you must inspire them to act better. even if you react violently, what would you think would happen after that? nothing good, you may even not return home alive, or not on your legs. next time someone says something bad, use logic, not emotions, emotions are unnatural, nature works following what is the solution that works best, its creations are based upon a logic process, not bursts of bitterness against a species and feelings of empathy for another being, or else everything would be destined to fail."
Active_Explanation49,ISTP,"why do so many feelers percieve thinkers as people who don't care and don't love/feel anything? there is a common misconception that thinkers' being cold means we are just cold machines that cannot empathise with our loved ones. what do you think about it, why is being cold seen as a bad thing, amd why can't people see trough it?

edit: for feelers, I said ""many feelers"",not every one of you, don't feel called out please."

Active_Explanation49,ISTP,"Everywhere I go since I was a child my mom and friends always pushed me to ""not be so depressed"" or ""to stop being shy"". very few extroverts understand that introverts often like being with (the right) people, they just aren't as cheerful or smiley as extroverts. imo there should be more social awareness of this.

edit: ok some people misunderstood the quotes, I'm not saying we are depressed or shy, I'm saying that extroverts often think that since we don't interact much with others we are shy or socially awkward."
Active_Explanation49,ISTP,They are my 3rd favourite personality type after istp and intp.
Active_Explanation49,ISTP,"I am surprised by how many ISTPs say they constantly overthink everything, I just don't care about other's opinion and I don't mind being arrogant/whatever sometimes.

edit: yes they absolutely are."
Active_Explanation49,ISTP,"screentime is a modern issue that can limit one and making them not living their life to the fullest. although the ancient Greeks and Roman weren't familiar with modern day society, Marcus Aurelius wrote in his personal journal (now published as ""the meditations"") about doing what we are created for:

""Everything, a horse, a vine, is created for some duty. For what task, then, were you yourself created? A man‚Äôs true delight is to do the things he was made for.‚Äù -(Book 8 paragraph 19.)

by that Marcus Aurelius clearly express that we are made to do something, and daily distractions are something we must learn to manage and, sometimes, remove from our lives. this can be applied to modern lifestyle by taking a moment to consider what we need and how to do what we're created for without letting daily obstacles overwhelm us to the point where we are no longer in control of our lives."
obelixthegaul,INTP,"Hello ISTPs. I (33M) have an ISTP (24F) neighbour who I am developing feelings for. 

We've lived next to each other for a couple of years and spoken here and there (usually to co-ordinate weed), but the last couple of months we've been hanging out more often. We eat pizza and watch movies or listen to music and chat about stuff until early hours of the morning.

We have also started sharing things about our lives with each other; eg, she had some annoying drama with some friends that I gave her advice on, she tells me about mental health struggles she has, and she consoled me when my dad died recently.

She came out of a long term relationship a few months ago and is still single, stays home 7 days a week except for work and as far as I know, no other dudes are hanging out with her.

With the data out of the way: problem is, we are both IxTPs and I have no idea whether this is just casual and friendly for her, or she might be developing feelings too. Probably, she has no idea about mine either, because I don't flirt either, even though I have to suppress imagining all the things I would do to her if I got the chance whenever we're together.

It's not as simple as ""just ask"" because we're neighbours, and I do value her friendship so I don't want to jump the gun or break things.

My questions for you are: a) does the fact that she wants to chill frequently, and opens up about the inside of her head, increase the odds that the feelings are mutual or does it indicate nothing?

And b) if a friend expresses feelings that you don't reciprocate how likely are you to pull back from the friendship?"
obelixthegaul,INTP,"Hello wonderful people. It was my birthday recently and every year, my INFP ex from 20 years ago remembers and wishes me a happy birthday. I don't have my birthday listed on social media, she just remembers and reaches out. Even when the last message between us was me wishing her a happy birthday six months earlier. 

She's such a sweetie and is the only non-family to remember or say anything. It doesn't bother me that others don't, but it's very sweet that she does."
SToP_BotherIng_Pls,ISTP,I've seen SO many people doing this so why don't I do it? Fine if you hate us but I seriously see so many people doing this. Every single day. Why tho?
SToP_BotherIng_Pls,ISTP,"There are so many stereotypes that low Fe users are just emotionless robots but people know by now that it's just a big stretch. Except, I've seen people changing their diagnosis on someone's type because they are talkative. You can be naturally talkative, outgoing, friendly and still be an introvert. Especially, a Ti dom.

I've seen SO many people type me as an ESFP because I am good with words and I talk a lot... and ISTPs in general, people I know keep on typing them as extraverts.. same with INTPs typed as ENFPs. Someone told me my dad might be an ENFP and it was hilarious.

Anyways, I am saying this because I think of high Fe as wanting everyone in the group to be in harmony with each other. If you have low Fe but are talkative and expressive in that way, it doesn't mean your not a Ti/Te dom, it can also mean that you are there just to enjoy, not to ensure harmony in the group. 

For example, me. I am a pretty talkative person. I usually talk about shit that happened in the past and I could go on and on about it until every detail is met. And no, I am not secretly an ISXJ. I am pretty active in social gatherings and stuff. I don't want to be the center of attention, but I am definitely not hidden. Of course, unless I don't know anyone. But I do this again, not to ensure harmony within but to enjoy myself. 

What do you guys think about this? Is it relatable or is it just me? Even if you have high Fe, you can answer btw."

My dad has work stuff both here and where we used to live so we move back and forth a lot. There even used to be an inside joke in my schools and neighborhoods because of it lol.

Anyways, recently, I've been crushing him a lot more than I usually do. I never bother to look for signs but I've started recently because I've realized my 'feelings' I guess. And even after I started, I still can't notice things that easily even if I try ugh. 

To get to the point, how am I supposed to make a move. I am not the type to make a move, ever but now I want to. What do you guys like? My brother is an ENTP so I try to observe stuff he likes but his Pi is annoyingly weak so he refuses to talk about it.

Hello fellow ISFP's

20 year old ISTP here

I'm currently struggling a bit about the my love life so I've met this wonderful ISFP girl and we just instaneously clicked, we had alot of interests in common, we spoke about what we are currently studying (geology in my case) and as I told her I was doing field work in a very cute place she immediately said that she'd like for me to take her there, notice I've never met her when this happened and we were only speaking for a couple of days through social media. Obviously I was kinda hyped because it's not everyday someone takes interest in my field. So I told her that I could take her some day in the near future there, but then 1 day later she said it was probably better to wait until she finished her exams, i understood obviously and said ""yeah that's alright"". A month passes, everyday we speak still vibing as we were before, and about 7 days ago we go out for the first time, she asked me to hangout with her friends bc we had some mutual friends because of a group chat we were both involved in. After we're finished she pm's me saying she had a blast and had alot of fun with me. Then I asked her if we wanted to go out only us two and she said yes, I take her to lunch, it was really fun, not awkward at all, and then we go to a nearby park which is a really Zen spot and we sit in a quiet bench, we are talking about something and she kisses me, I obviously kiss her back and at this point I'm panicking because this never happened, but deep down I'm euphoric because I really like the girl. we had stuff planned the next day with that group of friends and just proceeded to ignore whatever happened the day before, but as soon as it's only us two, she kisses me back again and since I had the place to myself (I live with my brother) we went in and just watched some Netflix while cuddling. Postponing to a couple days ago, she said that she doesn't want anything serious and she doesn't want attachments because of really shitty ex's and would like to maintain whatever we have, she also said something about friends with benefits. Now my problem is, I've been speaking for about 2 months now, and I truly enjoy spending time with her, and I don't want meaningless sex, also I'm more of a date and romantic clingy person I guess.  


She is coming over tomorrow and i'm pretty sure she wants to take it to the next level aka sex.  
its not that i dont want it perhaps im just more interested in a connection than the intimacy? if that makes sense  


From what i've experienced ISFP tend to be super loving and caring so not sure what to expect here tbh

So if you did bother to read the whole thing, what do you think i should do?

TLDR: Seeing this ISFP girl, we make out, i like her, she doesn't want to get attached"

kokoroKaijuu,INTP,"You guys have probably already encountered a million posts exactly like this one so thank you for taking the time to read it if you do, I welcome all opinions and thoughts :)

For a while now I've identified as INTP. All of my interests, habits, cognitive processes, etc. seem to line up with this type after some research so it'd make sense.

However, I'm noticing more and more that people tend to comment that I behave more like an ISTP (both through MBTI and not), and my personality lines up with many ISTP descriptions as well. I crave independence and I go insane when I'm stuck in one place for too long, I struggle with other people and I prefer to be alone, I try to be as objective and logical as possible, and I'm quite observant and in tune with my environment in general.

However, at times I feel like more of an INTP, where I tend to be more indecisive than straightforward and direct, and I like to indulge my strange ideas and explore them more abstractly or hypothetically. My interests also line up more with INTP; I've never once been fascinated by vehicles or sports or fixing stuff (although I am extremely curious about how most things work), I'm more intrigued by the capacity and pursuit of human knowledge and STEM-related things."

4:00 AM: After another productive night of browsing the Internet and creating funny maymays for Reddit using popular references such as Big Chungus, Keanu Reeves, and Reddit Gold, as well as surfing through Wikipedia for useless knowledge in fields I am totally unqualified to speak about, I would say I have deserved a good night's sleep. Of course, right by the side of my lovely anime loli bodypillow. Goodnight, Internet!"
kokoroKaijuu,INTP,"just remove it. Everyone knows there are actually 8 types

ISFP and INFP are obviously the same thing so they cancel out and we just have IFP

we also have

ETJ
EFJ
ITJ
IFJ
ETP
ITP
EFP

this would also end sensor discrimination while also getting rid of them for good. It's a win win"
Limmerskit,INTP,"I've found INTJs usually hold extreme/aggressive political stances, and I've avoided them--once that propensity comes out--for that reason. However, in a turn of fate, this INTJ and I ended up becoming close. 

He's fun to hang out with if a bit pushy and irresponsible, but his political tirades get tiring, and I'm wondering if that'll ever change. People mellow with age, and I would like to be friends long-term, but I'm curious if any INTJs or people who know INTJs know if/when that mellowing happens."
Limmerskit,INTP,"Some questions for 8s: 

1. Do you *need* conflict to develop trust/respect/affection?
2. If so, at what point do you pull back and stop the fighting? 
3. How do you expect others to respond to your challenges or conflict in general? 

Enneagram seems to have a great effect on the ways types use their functions, maybe to the point an enneagram's attitude defines types common to that enneagram more than the types themselves."
Limmerskit,INTP,"This ISFP I met is pretty cool, and we've hung out a few times now. However, we run out of things to talk about fairly quickly and end up just chilling and gaming.

Are you happy and content when you're in just-chilling-not-talking mode? Everything's good; I'm just not used to complete silence with people, like I need to be doing more. 

Appreciate you all."
Limmerskit,INTP,"Si's one of my favorite functions, but mine's sloppy, so I'd appreciate your insite. 

How does dominant Si operate step-by-step in your problem solving? 

How does living with dominant Si feel? i.e. how does Si kick around in your head moment-to-moment? 

I'm awful with unexpected events or abrupt changes, but I'm thinking that may be characteristic of weaker Si, not Si in general. When confronted with sudden and serious/permanent change, how do you feel and what's your first move?"
Limmerskit,INTP,"I've noticed lower-Se types, NJs, always mention ""wanting to give people good experiences."" I've seen that commonly tied to Se, or the insecurity of weaker Se. 

As Se-doms, do you see or relate to the ""giving people good experiences"" aspect of Se? If so, how does that work when it comes naturally to you? 

Appreciate the insight. Love ESFPs <3"
Limmerskit,INTP,"I always wanted to try the Sims, and 3 was on sale, so I picked it up and started an ISTP-INTP household. It was so much less and so much more than I expected. 

Early:

1. INTP and ISTP never really speak. They alternate cooking and chores. 
2. ISTP moves into the garage, sells most of his belongings, and buys a gaming PC. 
3. INTP sells most of his belongings to buy a telescope. His lifetime happiness increases, and then he gets bored of it. He sells his telescope and most other belongings and buys a gaming PC. 
4. ISTP and INTP sort of just work, come home, fiddle with their skills or exercise a bit, play games, sleep, and then repeat the process the next day. 
   1. Side note: they're in the ""Late Night"" expansion which is centered around night life and socializing. Neither go out or socialize. They just work and play games. 

This went on for like two hours. Neither ISTP nor INTP were particularly happy. I was feeling some existential dread but also laughing. Fortunately, things started happening.

Mid:

1. ISTP befriends his boss, a D-list celebrity, who drags him out to some nightclubs. ISTP gets drunk, beats up a celebrity, and gets noticed because he's hot, knows a D-list celebrity, and beats up a B-list celebrity. ISTP accidentally becomes a C-list celebrity. 
   1. An image consultant pushes ISTP to work out more. ISTP does. ISTP accidentally becomes a fitness icon. ISTP gives health and wellness lectures between his shifts at the labs. 
      1. ISTP hates going out and being in crowds but loves new experiences. ISTP goes out for drinks after work because his boss asks him to. ISTP comes home elated he had fun but also stressed and furious he was around too many people.
   2. Calling repair people to fix broken appliances is expensive, so ISTP decides to fix those appliances himself. ISTP accidentally becomes an ISTP. ISTP upgrades the home's few appliances just because he can. Then, with nothing to do, he uninstalls those upgrades and installs new ones just because he can. ISTP accidentally becomes an ISTP-A. 
   3. ISTP starts earning good money.
2. INTP realizes he doesn't have the time to pursue his dreams working a 9-5. INTP is woke af and knows he's living in a simulation, so he quits his job and writes.
   1. INTP practices writing. 
      1. When INTP takes a break to use the restroom, he forgets what he was doing and stands in the bathroom for an hour. When he comes out, INTP realizes the counter is dirty and freaks out. Cleaning the counter raises his lifetime happiness. When ISTP comes home, INTP discusses conspiracy theories with him. ISTP thinks INTP is okay. 
   2. INTP's goals (""promises"") all revolve around improving and succeeding with his skill. INTP feels dirty, hungry, and distracted so often he almost never progresses his skill. 
      1. INTP becomes furious he isn't meeting his goals. INTP becomes furious at his own bodily needs. 
      2. INTP ignores his physical and mental needs, literally goes insane, and finally publishes. 
   3. INTP starts earning good money. 

At this point, I was having a blast. ISTP's succeeding and has so many things going on but couldn't care less. All he wants to do is work out and game. INTP's having meltdowns over nothing every minute and talking to himself. He's lost his mind and has accepted that. ISTP and INTP have been living together for around 6 months and still don't know anything about each other. 

Now:

1. ISTP's earning insane money, making breakthroughs in fitness and physics, and rising in stardom solely by working out and fixing things, and all he wants is a hot tub and a new car. 
2. INTP's living off royalties and going out every night. He discusses conspiracy theories with strangers who don't care, and he argues with/fights the same bouncer every night. 
3. ISTP and INTP are still barely more than acquaintances."
Limmerskit,INTP,"When you notice and confirm a serious issue--usually with other people--you can't change, how do you neutralize that ""this will cause problems"" instinct in yourself? Beyond the basic faking it, I mean: how do you turn your brain off to the problem? 

Regarding work, I've noticed a problem which won't change. I'm fixating on it because it is a problem, but I'd rather not think about it because that problem won't really wreck anything. It'll just add 15% more stress the next few years. But it won't wreck anything. So I don't want to think about it. But I can't stop thinking about it. How INTP turn off bad-bad think?"
Limmerskit,INTP,"With inferior-Fe, I want everyone feeling happy and harmonious, but my immediate response to angry/antagonistic/aggressive people is either to shut down or get angry myself. 

How do you calm angry people or make aggressive people like you? And, if/when you succeed, how do you feel about them afterward?"
StareOut,ISTP,I‚Äôve been seeing this a lot lately so I just wanted everyones‚Äôs thoughts on it
fuckcreepers,ISTP,"Why do God nor goddess ever show affection or anything towards their other kids? Hell they didn't even talk to them, didn't say bye, when they left.

Ik God had a retirement party but we don't see a personal connection between him and the other kids as much as luci or amenediel.

I find it upsetting cuz which child would like that and how are they all not turning into psychopaths like Michael did. Although Michael had his different reasons for it, but parents' neglect definitely fuelled it.

Idk it just kinda sucks to the the other siblings."
fuckcreepers,ISTP,"I'm just curious, if these things have anything to do with the personality
Even if not, I'd like to explore new flavours :p

Plus it's fun to talk about icecream

Mines chocolate chip :)"
fuckcreepers,ISTP,Mine's Nov 16
fuckcreepers,ISTP,"Like do yall ask others to take a personality test too? Or yall just observe and guess? Or yall ask them..? It's just confusing for me, how others come upto this sub and say, omg I'm in love with an ISTP. HoW dO yOu kNoW fOr sUrE?? Idek what I am myself, cuz every site says something else!!

I wonder if it's just me, smh"
Zealousideal_Mix_629,ISTP,"This question is open to all types, but if not an ISTP please start by noting your type, thanks. 

What animals do you dread coming face to face with and why? I, like many ISTPs I'm sure, engage in lots of outdoor activities. For the most part animals and bugs don't bother me. Snakes, bears, whatever I don't give them a second thought when in the woods. But there are 3 I do fear:

-Cougar/Mountain Lions//Puma: They see us as prey
-Raccoon: They are smart and not scared of humans
-Opossum: They are mean when cornered, and what they lack in intelligence they make up with pure rage energy.

So animals scare you and why?"
GothicEmperor69,ISTP,"Age:
Gender: Male
Description: Just a 15 year old kid crusing through life 

Medical: No

Upbringing: Atheist. part of family Christian (Grandparents and cousins) no complications 

Job: None, will be helping out at an engineering company , not working but helping out and learning (job experience) im pretty sure I‚Äôll like it 

If i had to spend a week alone I would feel refreshed I like being alone

I do matial arts -> karate, I‚Äôve been doing it for a long time, Fighting is fun it keeps me active 

I would say I‚Äôm curious if I‚Äôm able to do something with it  later, for example I like mechanical stuff because I want to work with it and it would be good to know how to work with it, im also getting into computer sciences because that would be helpful later when the world is becoming more technological and people will always be needed for that. So yes I would say I‚Äôm pretty curious. 

I would take a leadership role if I really had to. I used to be good talking to people but I‚Äôm not good at it no more. If I had to my style would be as honest and blunt as possible and people will have to follow. I would do what I can do to support the people, and if we get to what we need we will do what has to be done.

I like working with my hands, building things would be really fun, if I had the resources and the money. I would say pretty coordinated martial arts helped with that.

No im not artistic and I don‚Äôt make any. I appreciate art if it makes sense like a lion or a snake. But if its just random paint splatter on a canvas (aka waste of money)

You cant change the past, cant predict the future(distant), but what you can do as much as you can in the now.

Ill help them, except if im in capable of it, Ill then advise them to someone else.

Yes I need logic in my life.

Efficiency is important

No I don‚Äôt control others they should figure out their own path doesn‚Äôt mean they can ask for help

Martial arts and gaming building stuff and taking stuff apart. It keeps me active.

I like using my physical senses, sitting around listening to someone babble for an hour bores me and I can‚Äôt concentrate and I will forget. When I actually do something I remember it better and it interests me longer. That‚Äôs why I like experimenting  it‚Äôs interesting and fun.

I tend to improvise as I go along 

Family and that I do well in life 

That I earn a decent amount of money and that I have fun


I think suspense is nice but also tedious. I hate when people arn‚Äôt direct because I won‚Äôt notice hints.

When Im happy
When Im bored

I daydream but really only when Im extremely bored and I do still pay attention to whats happening.
If I where in an empty room I would think about how in wasting my time and what I could do to get arrid of the boredom for example exercise.

I tend to way both options carefully and see which has the most benefit. This can take a while 1min and up. Once I made a decision I stick to it because I know the benefits both options offer.

I don‚Äôt see emotions to be Important in my life, I see them as more of a hindrance than anything else. Being overly emotional can be very annoying and I wouldn‚Äôt say I get emotional either.

If I agree with someone its because I‚Äôm getting bored and I want to leave or because I feel like im wasting to much energy with this conversation (maby because its becoming more of a I feel like ...)

I would break rules if they are nonsensical if there is a reason why its in place and it makes logical sense aright but If its something I don‚Äôt agree with and it has no logical backing I wouldn‚Äôt follow it.

A life where I have the resources to do as I please and am not controlled and need someone to support me"
GothicEmperor69,ISTP,"What I mean by that is:

Someone sends you something and expects a reaction but you don't show any or feel anything, but to even show just the slightest amount of appreciation you fake a slight smile?(If its something humorous)"
GothicEmperor69,ISTP,"(Repost because I was told my otherone was biased)

I've done 2 different tests 1 where Im clearly an Istp and one where Im an Istj but the ""j"" is at 1% meaning I can be both.

Maby something to help:

-Good with change possibly because I dealed alot with it 

-I like building stuff (when I have the resources)

-Phisics and chemistry is really fun especially experiments 

-Like being alone but can be extroverted for a little bit with people I like 

-Procrastinates

-Wears comfy sporty clothes

-When I feel like I work well for a bit and then I get bored 

-I would say Im more of a logical thinker

-Preferes that people get straight to the point because nonsensical rambleing gets difficult to listen more 

-Be honest 

-Likes horror games (movies are predictable games are too but you can actually do something)

-I do alot of sh** last minute annoying the crap out of people


-I would also say Im more of a loyal person but I've never been in a relationship

-I have a tendency to daydream 

-I stand by the fact that actions speak louder than words 

-I do martial arts also did wrestling for a bit 

-Dislikes people wishing me a happy birthday because I know I will not be able to do that same 

-Would go parachute jumping but not bungee jumping 

-Dislikes silence but does enjoy being alone 

-Hates beimg bored normally have something to do

-Dislikes passive aggressiveness comunicate or I will ignore you

-Shitty and dry sense of humour 

-Can't take compliments

You can call this biased if you want but also ask some questions because I cant think of any more"
GothicEmperor69,ISTP,"I was rejected 2ce in my life and well others where balling thier eyes out when rejected, I didn't feel sad nor angry or upset I remained completely neutral and just went on with my life."
GothicEmperor69,ISTP,"Do you also have a tendency to try and explain emotion with logic?

What I mean by the logic part is that if someone told me they have a fear of the dark and they don't know why. I would come back to human instinct and that this fear was caused partially due to evolution and survival since its unknown territory. The fear of the ""unknown"" --> not knowing if a preditor is lingering."
International-Fox127,ISTP,"hi, I just kissed a girl at the end of our third date and it was my first initiative and I was kinda clumsy, usually girls sended me signals or kissed me directly at parties so I never been really good at initiate it. Do you guys find it difficult to be romantic and vulnerable (even if you don't have feelings yet) ? I'm not good at it and I wanna improve myself but it feels kinda hard. May be the only domain when istp aren't confident is vulnerability"
Abakchi,ISTP,"You feel like your feelings will explode you and do things with passion? Also intense horny?

Wandering_Tradesman,ISTP,"I'm a female high schooler who's been under stress at home for a while (I have a lot of siblings and my family is really loud). I'm also taking some summer classes and they are contributing to my rising stress. To kind of get away from everything going on in my life, I've been spending way too much time on my computer doing random shit. The issue is that that only makes the problem worse because I'm not actually doing anything to fix my situation, which gives me anxiety, which adds to my stress. I'm also seriously considering dropping out of high school and then taking the GED (General Educational Development. It's basically the equivalent to a high school diploma.), an idea that my mom doesn't like. I feel like shutting down and just crying, but crying makes me feel terrible and I can't shut down because my parents would just start asking me what's wrong without actually caring or helping. I'm sorry if this is kind of all over the place, I feel like I'm going insane. So, yeah. What do you do when you feel like shutting down?

Edit: Thank you to all those who responded. I think that just writing this stuff down and posting has made me feel a lot better. I will still be trying some of you suggestions out, though."
