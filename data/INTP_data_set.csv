Zachiyo,INTP,I'm currently trying to find an affordable flex plate system that I can buy for my flashforge creator pro and haven't had any luck finding anything. Was wondering if anyone knows of any stores or brands that sell some that would fit the printer (6.25x9.25 or 235mmx155mm) that are decent quality or even just a list of stuff I could use to make my own.
Zachiyo,INTP,That is of course with the exception of uni classes that I can't exactly go to anymore because of covid and work interactions. Is this lack of talking something that you find easily manageable or does it actually lead to something worse down the road?
Zachiyo,INTP,Does anyone have any tips for printing screw threads (preferably without the use of supports)? Currently on the opposite side to the cooling fan the thread will curl upwards while printing and cause it to be horribly distorted (this also happens on the cooling fan side but not as bad) and gets worse as it goes higher (printing with PLA in flashforge creator pro)
Zachiyo,INTP,"I got a flashforge creator pro on Christmas and it's been great with printing things first try almost every time on the default settings and modes. Now I have a new roll of brown filament that just doesn't seem to work well, it prints fine for a bit and then it starts to get stringy, even on the finest setting and I'm not sure if it has to do with temperature from it being a much darker colour or something or if it might just be a bad spool. All of my filament has been pla and I've been using the default slicer settings in flashforge"
Lovis_R,INTP,"So I'm 22m, had sex once when I was 18 and on holiday, and I just can't imagine any girl actually being attracted to me. And even if I think, maybe potentially a girl could be into me, I usually just assume, that I'm just thinking to much, and she's probably definitely not actually into me.

Is there something wrong with me, or is that something other people also deal with?"

Basically after i went jogging on tuesday my shins hurt, didnt think much about it and just assumed it was delayed onset muscle soreness (? is there no shorter way to describe it?),  
 but when i was trying to jog today, i got like 30 yards, untill the pain of jogging was unbearable. so i went back home, and googled my symptoms, and im 99% sure i have Shin splints.

Now my question, could it be something else? And should i go to the doctor(free) or would that just be a waste of time?"

InfiniteWonderer8,INFJ,The time has come for me to ask my INTP out and I am truly concerned with the approach I should take for it to be a success. The chemistry is naturally there but there was this push and pull game due to previous issues with trust. How do I proceed? Suggestions are welcome!
InfiniteWonderer8,INFJ,"Hey it’s me again. I need to rant and need your advice dear INTPs.
I’ve encountered probably one of the most amazing human beings on Earth. He got me to discover my true, deeper self, by his sheer demeanour and spirit. We connected so deeply, that I finally felt what was missing in my previous relationships without putting it into words. It’s just meant to be, as cliche as it sounds. Honestly, affection towards him comes naturally. There’s no conditions and we’re bound to be finally in each other’s presence.

The issue arises with my demeanour- I tend to come of as a wild card even though that’s just how I cope with the excitement of it all. He actually slipped up first and admitted he likes me, which made me so incredibly happy because the feeling is mutual. I just didn’t want to seem too eager or anything and came off as a player.

Long story short, I just want to tell him everything that’s on my mind and pour my heart out, but I fear that in all scenarios, I’ll just end up pushing him away.

Plus I’m pretty sure we’re TFs, but that’s a story for another time. 

INTPs, do you want us to be straight to the point because at this point I can’t hold it in any longer."
InfiniteWonderer8,INFJ,"Hey there, my sweet INTPs! 
Once again, I need your insight.

After riding the many waves, highs and lows of our interaction with my all time favourite INTP and human being, I have decided to make a serious move and actually travel to meet him.

There just isn’t anyone that captivates me the way he does. Trust me, I am trying to go out there and forget he even exists with all the other people around me. But all I can think of is … him.

I want to meet him and actually give this a shot - it just feels right and good and real.

I don’t want to scare him away - he tends to pull away as soon as get on my high horse but it isn’t intentional - he just really excites me.

Any tips on how to approach him and rekindle the feeling irl? 

Thanks."

chuunibyoucringeboi,INTP,"All I think about 24/7 is very existential stuff. Not sophisticated or smart stuff necessarily. It's just how I am, I think some INTPs relate. 

Small talk, meaningless conversations, etc, are extremely exhausting to INTPs (I think?) but I guess I never realized that the opposite is also the same. When I think about it like that, it really changes my perspective. Felt like sharing that."
chuunibyoucringeboi,INTP,"I hear it from everyone eventually. Can't count the number of times I've been accused of ""not caring."" Comes in many forms:

""Is there anyone you care about?""

""Do you care about me?""

""I'm not sure if you actually care or not"" 

I'm so tired of feeling like a broken person because I ""don't care,"" yeah well maybe I don't, and so what? Am I supposed to find a way to force myself? Or maybe I do cry, but if you're not around to see it in the first place, then why would I answer your thoughtless question?"
sleepyj910,INTP,"Some random thoughts maybe related to INTPness.

Twitch: Maybe I'm just out of touch (no, no, the children are wrong), but the idea of watching other people play video games feels like of waste of time wherein I could be playing my own games.  And I sure as heck don't want people to see what I'm doing.  It's such a popular thing and so unappealing in every way to me lol

MMOs: I like the open and complex world for sure, but sometimes it's like every other player just exists to give me chores, or randomly kill me and the fun is sucked away.

FPS: Some are quite addictive, and I enjoy the tactics, but nowadays they want me to have a mic?  Nah, you're not hearing what I sound like.

Games I like: I love managing resources and shit.  Civ, Xcom, Factorio, etc.  The longer the campaign can go on the better, I don't ever want games to end.  Let me in the zone and then realize it's 3AM so I can collapse and dream about it some more."

sleepyj910,INTP,"So early this spring I end up with what I think is poison ivy all up my forearm.  Skin is itchy as fuck, scabbing up, open woundish etc.  I'm stubborn for a few days but it keeps getting worse so the wife sends me to this emergency care center that she went to when she nicked her finger with a box cutter.

&#x200B;

The doc calls it contact dermatitis and prescribes steroids, which worked great, yay.

&#x200B;

2 months later, now I have a bill for $1100 because my insurance says non emergency emergency visits are ineligible.  Mind you this was not a hospital, just a clinic that apparently bills you at emergency room rates?  True, it does have the word emergency in it's name.  There were no other patients there and they did not ask if it was emergency, though I'm sure I signed something agreeing to paying emergency rates.

&#x200B;

Do I have any hope of fighting this?  If so what approach should I use? Did I just fuck up by simply not knowing the clinic treated itself as an emergency room and we just have to gamble on what is determined an emergency?  (I mean, it wasn't life threatening but it was serious to me and the fam or stubborn me wouldn't have bothered seeking immediate help.)  I certainly wouldn't have wasted a hospital emergency room's time with it, I did not realize that non hospitals could claim to be ERs.

sleepyj910,INTP,"Not sure if this is the right subreddit, but my wife and I were on vacation with my friend and his wife, among others.  This girl is very sexually minded (if you say the word 'wood' she'll probably make a dick joke) but is very cheerful and friendly.

At one point she was in the middle of the couch with two girls, one being my wife, quickly make a lesbian sex joke, and put her arms around them to grabs their breasts as part of the joke I guess.  Does she think it's not inappropriate because it's girl on girl??  Has anyone dealt with a situation like this?

My wife was too shocked to respond, and maybe didn't want to yell at this bubbly person who's probably just naive, but was angry for the rest of the night.  We'd like to approach this woman about this behavior before our next vacation but I'd love some tips...I don't want to shame this girl for being sexual, and I feel like I don't have the best arguments prepared for why she should not assume that she can grope her friends like that?
  
How can I help empower my wife to say 'hands off'?  Any good resources for changing this sort of 'same sex groping is okay' feel?

I want to explore the possibilities further for Se. This single explanation barely covers the surface from my perspective. I personally need to bounce ideas off of other people before the idea becomes solidified. 


So here are some questions.

[ratatatatata](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/terminator/images/a/a4/Arnie-minigun.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20081119201100)

Is Se all about presentation? Say for instance I have trouble conveying wording in a acceptable format. IE: Resumes, essays, articles, replies to emails, or anything along that manner. 

How is interaction between a Se user and a Si user? Is it more effective and easier to understand to just replicate the opposite? 

Se prefers phone, Si prefers email true or false? 

Is Se always aware of their appearance? 

Do Se users follow rituals because they will forget? 

How does one go about explaining complex theory in a acceptable format for a Se user? 

How resistant are Se users to change and how do they change?

Are Se users better at aiming in video games but insanely predictable? 

Where do you find Se users at? Name 10 places if you can.

How does one go about shared experiences if one does not even begin to understand them? IE: Finding these rituals mundane and annoying. However trapped in this rituals because others see them as no alternative. 

Should a Si user in order to survive in the world only communicate in short order and keep their thoughts and intentions hidden?"

Maybe i'm a bit too high to think right but i was wondering about the ratio of augm. a spartan can get ONLY from his armor and the ratio of gains on each spartan class along with digressing on a question on Mjolnir armors manufacturer (and/or goverment), that's the subject.

However, i do recall reading on this subreddit about how a S4 with a newer armor can be as strong and as physically efficient as a S2. M'right?

That got me thinking... First MK, they were told they could be the only one wearing them because it kills a normal hooman. I do remember Halsey saying something like ""We **Think** you'll be able..."". 

Then foward to S4 being as strong as S2 with the same armor because of their augmentation. 

Are we really sure that S2s bodies were not pushed to their real limit with an even stronger armor than S4?

Could it be that they want to out S2s, not keep them shining (shit, they silll young) ?

Could they conspire to level down S2s to S4s with armors that are not best suited for them ? Could the manufacturer not want to exploit the maybe hidden potential of the S2s because it's cheaper to make  mass produced armors for the S4s according to their level and just ""underequip"" the S2s?. Could it be an order from UNSC or whatever? (why not both?)

Edit:  Thanks again for all the advice.  A deal alert hit and I was able to get the Logitech for $30 from B&H so I pulled the trigger.  Hopefully it can get me far enough along in MSFS2020 so I can decide to upgrade to a better stick or maybe go for a yoke."

sebbyluv,INTP,"I worked for Lowe's for a little less than a year and my rep suggested I try and get a job with SW. I had the opportunity, I went for it, and now we're here. I just wanted to point out some things that stuck out to me.. one fuckin tinter. Between me and my GM, we made 250 gallons of paint before noon, 90% of them being 5-gals. As we all know, those take a minute to fill up with colorant, so the buckets just piled and piled waiting to get filled. I understand there isn't really a point to having another tinter if you only have so many spinners, but at least it would knock out the a amount of time one would have to sit and worry about tinting rather than spinning, which is a much easier thing to work with. Half way through the day the green got clogged and caused an awful mess, so it slows down everything if anything happens to the one tinter in the store. I just assumed a store that has a line of contractors to the door all day would have more machinery to work with since it's mostly large orders. 

Next thing I noticed was your POS. I know this isn't just SW, lots of companies have had the same systems for years. It's just, a company like SW I'm sure has the time to make their POS more than just sparadic lines of code that make newbies want to off themselves.  I know it isn't that bad once you get to using it but, shit it could be a lot better. To preform a simple task you have to go through like 80 pages of garbage to get to where you need to be. 

""hey can you look up a color I bought a few years ago"" 

""yeah sure just give me 15 minutes."" 

I feel like Jump in the Line by Harry Belafonte should just be blasting on the sales floor for the poor bastards who have to wait to order and then wait to actually get their paint. 

Now my new store is definetly understaffed, but even then, I feel like even with added people, there isn't much more you can do in terms of serving customers any faster when all the spinners are going and there's a fuckin conga line to use the tinter.

Lastly, why are there no cameras in the store? I'm not sure if any stores have them or not but, after the horror stories I heard today, it just seems ridiculous there aren't any. Literally just one on the sales floor is all you need. My assitant manager had a man follow her into the back and harass her, would be a nice time to show some proof. 

At the end of all this, I'm happy about my new job, and im excited to be working for this company. A lot of things just came as a surprise to me."

Alpha-GRRL,ENTP,"Kaltxì!  I’m a DM who’s currently starting an intergalactic campaign because I just love sci-fi plots and alien species so much!!! The species I’m planning to use will mostly not be Na’vi, (but there might be a few Na’vi relevant to the campaign and I know at least one of my players will want a character that is Na’vi) and everyone else has probably had a bit of cultural influence from everyone else at sometime, save for the most remote and isolated folks. So just like how many westerners use names from France or Germany (despite never actually speaking French or German or having ancestry from such places in many cases), some of my characters might have Na’vi or Na’vi inspired names. 

If you’ve got some names inspired by the Na’vi language, let’s hear them!  Thank you in advance... DMing is hard but DMing a homebrew in space is even harder!"
Alpha-GRRL,ENTP,"Howdy costumers!  So I am working on a mutant rat mask sculpt for this year’s mad scientist room for the haunted attraction that I work at. Not exactly cosplay but the build is essentially within the realm. The base is entirely made from many, many layers of Worbla, but will obviously get the faux fur, silicone, sculpted teeth, eyes, mesh, etc. once the Worbla base is finished. I’m pretty much done with the sculpt at this point.  My goal is to make something durable enough to last me a few years even with the rough and tumble environment of haunt and a few conventions.  I’m considering adding a final layer of EVA to the exterior of the sculpt to smooth out some of the bumps from the layers of Worbla. 

I’m just curious how EVA holds up to sweat and washing. I like to wash my costumes with faux fur and other fabrics weekly to avoid mildew, mold, and just to maximize the costume’s lifespan and to keep the costume safe, not stinky/dirty, and looking beautiful. What’s been your experience with EVA and moisture?  How does it handle washing, as well as sweat?  

I know many cosplayers will happily make whole builds from the stuff but from what I’ve used of it, it seems like it’d hold in moisture almost like upholstery foam if you’re not meticulous, which isn’t ideal in a setting where it’s facing almost daily usage for almost three months out of the year."

Alpha-GRRL,ENTP,"Meowdy again, cat lovers!  

So I have a sweet, super friendly black pregnant mama kitty (Bubbles, if you’ve been following her saga) that is slowly coming inside and becoming part of the family. The plan is to get her inside before her litter so she can be cool, comfortable, well-fed, and happy when having her babies and then take her to get spayed ASAP once it’s safe. It’s not all that hard to get her in. If I wanted to, I could just shut the door one of these times when she’s visiting. 


The only problem is that Bubbles has a little tortoiseshell kitten we like to call Spottedleaf. Spottedleaf is probably 8 weeks old but she’s very skittish and won’t come up to me yet. I’d love to get her spayed as well since it won’t be long before she’s looking for a Tom for litters of her own! I’d also hate to split up the family as I’ve seen the two get separated once and the baby didn’t stop crying for an hour until the mother finally found her and took her with her. I’d love to break the cycle by socializing Spottedleaf just like I did with her mom and eventually finding her a loving home. 

How should I go about getting her?  Should I try to befriend her like I did with Mom or trap her instead? I have access to a HaveAHeart trap large enough for kitties."

I don’t know how to tell whether I’m experiencing a crush or just really enjoying their company and honestly, at an age where it would typically be considered awkward to not be able to do so.

Prior_Technology_868,INTP,"Look, I can’t learn these things through psych articles or whatever i find on the web. It’s like reading a legal document. I need to vibe with something before i can understand it. Thus, I need other people’s input. 

How do INTP’s (Ti, Ne, Si, Fe) functions demonstrate themselves from your own experience?

For me its like this:

Ti: comes so naturally that I overlook it. Dealing with a venting girlfriend leads me to offer practical solutions and not hugs like she would want, though i’m improving on this. 
I do not cry when it would be normal to do so. My emotions are diluted but I’m not cold, more so clueless. 

Ne: I’m impulsive. Or rather, I act on impulse. But also I am creative, I love writing and worldbuilding. I’m into weird politics. I fantasize myself to sleep. Yada yada. 

Si: I get really nostalgic, and I don’t like changing my daily routines. Significant life changes like moving, getting a job etc. either distress me a lot or i am far gone from it. Uhhhh, I can’t stand change basically. 

Fe: i overanalyze when it comes to others. Sometimes i enter phases of feeling alone and really wish i were more social. When I AM social i might slip up and do something regrettable. After which it’s on my mind and ruins my day. It feels like ive damaged my expedition towards a healthier social life."
Prior_Technology_868,INTP,"Planning on asking out a girl I know on my track xc team. I’ll (18) be assisting my coaches next month so that’s when I’m going to do it. 

From what I’ve gathered she is an ENFP. She’s quite spontaneous which i think is endearing, she’ll strike up a conversation with anyone but has one introverted friend she sort of sticks to. You get the idea. 

I’m not sure what results I should expect, I’m not really scared of rejection or anything since I’m fairly casual in conversation so it should be fine. Just in case though I want to know how I ought to approach a relationship with an enfp. 

One fear i have is that I won’t be as social with her as I imagine i’d be. Right now I think i’d be fine with hanging out every day but in the past this would drain me a lot as is normal for intp’s. I appreciate affection and I’m able to reciprocate consistently (after having learned to the hard way…hehe). But it may be difficult if she requires a significant amount of time spent together. 

Another is that intp’s dont actually like to go out as much as enfps. I can imagine this getting in the way of the loose routine i have going on but i like getting out of the house so long as it is every day. Si thing ig. 

If we end up cohabiting far down the road, should I just do all the chores? I may be rubbed off by this. But if I must i have an idea on how to view this dynamic in a creative wAy. 

Lastly, do enfps really flirt with everyone? Ive never seen her do this, honestly, but if this is true how tf should i deal with this without…you know… feeling “impotent”? 
I hope you understand my concerns. I hope you understand. I am rather conservative when it comes to this issue.

Prior_Technology_868,INTP,"Nothing in life matters in the end. We’re all small and insignificant. Okay, what’s the point?

Maybe in seventh grade I’d have been into this kind of philosophy because of how deep and profound i’d see it as but it’s honestly such a dead end that there’s no reason to entertain the idea. 

Look, you have senses, a brain and various levels of consciousness that conjure some kind of sensations and complex feelings that are impossible to describe using materialistic vocabulary. 

Why not entertain these things? Why give any heed to nihilism?

ronaldtrip,INTP,"I need help people. Recently I was made aware by a member of /r/enneagram of a controlling streak in my posts and I have to admit that I do use a certain measure of control to keep things pleasant and peaceful. I also have no trouble stating my position when people really push my buttons and cross the uncrossable boundary. That would point to 9 wing 8, but I equally find myself irked when people break universally respected rules for their own ends and I do have an idealistic view on the world, which would point to 9 wing 1. (I know this is simplistic, but I'm trying to avoid a wall of text.) If it helps, most enneagram test results tend to be all over the place with nine just being a tad above the rest.

ronaldtrip,INTP,"The following are just a few thoughts, observations and experiences of mine. Just curious if it is only personal or more of a thread that runs through the life of nines.

&#x200B;

Conflict in my childhood home was an excercise in being overruled and provoking a frightening display of unreasonable rage. It was a constant tiptoeing around in fear of triggering that reaction. My needs for support and encouragement were mostly met with disdain, ridicule or disproportionate anger. At least that is how I felt about the responses. I learned to keep my head down.

&#x200B;

Deep down I am sitting on a vast well of rage. It is pitch black but searing hot. I am fearful of it because it could lead to complete destruction. It's controlled by my inner child. This child is screaming on the top of his lungs for justice. All the slights, insults, dismissals need retribution. The world won't give it to him, but he is willing to see the world burn until he gets it. Can't let him. So I'm inching around that anger and only dealing with it in the most indirect way possible. Afraid of what might be unleashed if confronted head on.

&#x200B;

I avoid conflict by keeping the battlefield empty. I only exist in the perifery of my 7w6 boyfriend. As such I am the boyfriend of and I can keep most people I ""don't know and trust"" at arm's length. Since we're not on the same playing field, serious conflict is unlikely to arise. Deep down I realise that I treat most connections as acquaintances while they deserve far better. I've taken care of my own stuff for so long now that I don't need to let them in. While life might become easier if I did, it is not like they are necessary to be there. I can handle things. On the surface level I am pleasant to the death of course.

&#x200B;

Paradoxically, I yearn for the connections I don't allow myself to make.

&#x200B;

Looking forward to your insights."
ronaldtrip,INTP,"Last Thursday (11th of October) was my birthday. Since it was also coming out day, I, in a spur of the moment thing, decided to send my parents a message. ""It is coming out day. I am polyamorous."" addd a link to morethantwo and waited for a response. Dead silence.

&#x200B;

The day after, dead silence. I finally gather my courage for a second time and send ""Hey have you recovered from the ""shock""?""

&#x200B;

I get back a very terse ""You don't have to tell us your orientation. That is private.""

&#x200B;

I semi-sarcastically respond ""Well, I'll try to keep Rob private..."" (Not really seeing a way to keep multiple partners secret in a town of 35,000)

&#x200B;

Only a ""Yes, thank you.""

&#x200B;

Now I am speechless. Deep down I knew I could get a negative reaction, but I didn't think through what my own reaction should be if they didn't take it well. You hope for acceptance. They didn't kick me out for being gay back then. Why should this be such a problem? But apparently it is.

&#x200B;

I'm trying to gather my thoughts and I am trying to come up with a way forward after they metaphorically slammed the door on me, but I am drawing a blank. I am not seeing how this can possibly work. As far as I am concerned, the genie is out of the bottle. I don't know how to face them and pretend it never happened. Knowing my parents as the emotional bricks they are, I can't bring this up again.

ronaldtrip,INTP,"Hey lovely people of /r/polyamory, this is a thank you note. I want to thank you for all the invaluable input and insights you have given us. It is your amazing openness and welcoming attitude to new comers that has given us the opportunity to start our journey on a healthy basis.

In a small recap, we were the couple considering to open up and allow feelings in, but we had a short list of damaging rules. Mostly out of fear and miscommunication.

With your patience and hepful input we were able to let go of our preconceived notions, designed to protect what we have with a moat. For now we have decided to take things slow and to use communication to navigate our way through this new reality. 

Communication and dedication born out of love have always been our supporting structure in our relatonship. Interacting with you reminded us that this is always the case and that this should be our M.O. in everything. Even in uncharted territory.

Once again thank you for being so patient with us and guiding us towards a better path to explore love. Your experience and wisdom has been instrumental in it.

ronaldtrip,INTP,"TL:DR below.

After my first post here (https://www.reddit.com/r/polyamory/comments/6b9fe7/discovering_we_might_be_poly_in_need_of_advice/), on which I got very valuable input and for which I am extremely grateful, we've (my boyfriend and I) decided to take things slow. We both don't want to Frankenstein another guy as a third limb onto our our relationship. The prospect of throwing another human being in the meat grinder because we aren't ready yet is something that terrifies us both.

That said, we are currently discussing how to proceed. I already know that our neat and simple ""rules"" we so cavalierly decided upon are the wrong starting point. I'll list them here (even if most of you guys probably have heard them all before).

* 1.) We only date as couple. (the thing I think we accepted without knowing the consequences)

* 2.) We both have veto rights. (the point of contention right now)

* 3.) We practise safer sex (including no swallowing...)

* 4.) Any added partner needs to be sexually compatible with both. (ties in with rule 1 and 2)

Looks simple no? Rule 3 probably is the best and only acceptable one on the list.

I've come to the conclusion that rules 1 and 2 are designed to cordon off our relationship from outside influences. Which makes establishing a relationship with someone else a very asymmetrical proposition. With 1 and 2 in place, we have the power to swat anyone away if we feel threatened. Which can't be the basis of a healthy and respectful relationship of any kind. 

I'm currently trying to ease my boyfriend into recognising that 1 and 2 are designed to basically  keep our ""monogamous"" unit intact. We had another heated exchange where I just posed hypotheticals and dilemmas. Along the lines of what happens if a situation arises where feelings don't develop symmetrically (quite likely) and one of us activates the nuclear option. I intentionally took the role of the antagonist in the examples. He recognised that feelings can't be turned off. At a certain point he thought to have found the solution in giving all prospecting partners veto rights, to which I countered that that gives anyone in the relationship the power to veto one of us out. (I'm very much aware that possibly throwing out the rules by agreement in the future doesn't necessarily mean they are not in place emotionally.)

I've come to the conclusion that for there to truly be a chance of love, there can't be stifling boxes designed on monogamous assumptions. That however means that any cookie cutter ""Disney happily ever after"" notion falls away as the default basis. The default boundaries are dissolving and new boundaries aren't formed yet, nor experienced. Which is a reality my boyfriend is not ready yet to fully embrace and one that is making me feel a little lost. How do you deal with feelings of uncertainty and not having a fixed framework anymore with which to define your current relationship?

I do realise that our feelings for each other have not changed one bit, but we've become accustomed to our little box and the prospect of not having those walls around us is a new and unknown situation.

TL;DR: Couple needs to let go of monogamous ""till death do us part"" assumptions and accept that to be polyamorous feelings can't be stifled. How to deal with feelings of uncertainty and not having a precanned definition of your existing relationship?"
ronaldtrip,INTP,"TL;DR below.

Hey /r/polyamory, this probably is the umpteenth ""new to poly, halp"" post, but we could use some advice or words of encouragement. My boyfriend (41) and I (42, M) opened our relationship (14+ years) in September last year. We were initially convinced it would ""just"" be a non-monogamous thing. So we looked up information on non-monogamy and trying to determine how it would work in our relationship. We had long talks about what motivated us to do this, what our fears were, what we could and couldn't do. We came to a pretty solid agreement (I think). We'd only have encounters together, only safe, some specifics about some inadmissible things in bed, both have veto rights, open communication and respect for each others feelings and thoughts. We also had a tentative agreement that closing back up was a possibility...

The decision to open up was an amazing thing for our relationship, because we've never been that honest and open towards each other ever before. We had some apprehension about actually bringing in someone else in the bedroom, but our first experience there was a positive one. We are not jealous of each other and it did not change our relationship negatively.

Apart from the earlier mentioned experience we haven't brought anyone else in. During the previous months we discovered that we both want more than just the casual thing. While I can do the casual thing, it is not very fulfilling for me. My boyfriend needs an emotional connection a priori to be able to share the bed with someone. We did spend a considerable time getting to know our third.

Two weeks ago I finally found the courage to come out to my boyfriend that I'm not wired for the mono thing. It is something I've struggled with for a very long time, trying to suppress my feelings and trying to adhere to societal norms. That was a pretty emotional thing, as that pretty much made the possibility to close up a no go. Lot's of fears and insecurities surfaced. We both are terrified of the prospect of losing each other. Which we probably won't, because our love runs very deep.

As an aside, because of the situation currently at work and the emotional roller coaster of the past few weeks I'm currently experiencing a mild depression. I'm working on overcoming that and the herbal remedy really helps in that regard. It has nothing to do with our discoveries perse, but for me it currently is a complicating factor.

My boyfriend and I have been struggling to find the right description for what we want. We didn't want the no strings attached thing, we thought we weren't looking for a partner. Most terminology out there didn't fit the bill. We (between us) used ""best friend in a living apart together arrangement"" as a working definition for a time. We were afraid to label it polyamory, as we were uncertain where that would leave our relationship. 

Past weekend though, we realised that we do want all the trappings of a relationship. We do want the emotional connection and the intimacy and we want any physical things that might happen to be backed by a deep emotional connection. For me, it makes sense that we are looking to date someone and build up more than just the chance of the occasional physical thing. I still have to talk more with my boyfriend on what he feels and thinks about this new reality. I'm confident we will figure things out between us. We're also in no hurry to dive into something. As for what we'll end up in, we realise that preconceived notions probably are pretty much unrealistic and therefore off the table.

I do feel like we could use some wisdom with regards to the way forward. Any tips, insights, experiences are appreciated.

ronaldtrip,INTP,"I'm currently in the process of switching to a more plant-based diet for health and environmental reasons. As a consequence I am brushing against the views of vegans online (got to get your recipes somewhere) and there is one thing that irks me to no end. The belief that eating plants is absolving you of killing.

We humans are beings of the mobile kind, so we are dependent on dead bodies of other organisms to sustain ourselves. Now, I could be wrong, but plants are lifeforms and as such are alive. So how can a vegan say with a straight face that eating plants is eating without killing? That plant was alive before you chomped it between your teeth. While admitting to yourself that you are a corpse eater is confrontational, it is an inescapable truth. We can't use our bodies to synthesise our own food.

There are many reasons why eating plant-based is a better way of living. Predominantly it enables us to feed more humans while using significantly less planetary resources producing food than the animal industry. One thing that isn't a valid reason is the false idea that it involves no killing.

What do you think?"

• How old are you? What's your gender? Give us a general description of yourself.

25, Male, In general I m known for being very hard working. Idle time drives me crazy. When I am upset or stressed about school, I throw myself into work to distract myself. I enjoy working out, but I can find some routine a bit overbearing and will need a day to recharge in this aspect. Other than that, I can keep routine pretty well. I don't necessarily keep a bullet journal but can keep a rough outline of things I need to throughout the day in my mind. Around a few people I am open with my emotions, like my boyfriend. I'm always early, never late. I can take charge of a situation pretty naturally too. It's more subconcious.

• Is there a medical diagnosis that may impact your mental stability somehow?

Depression/Anxiety.

• Describe your upbringing. Did it have any kind of religious or structured influence? How did you respond to it?

I wouldn't say religious. My mother exposed us to different religions growing up and my grandma was a jehovah's witness. I thought I was a jehovah's witness as a kid but when I found out I was gay, I cast it to the side and moved onto something else.  

A traumatic event that occured was when my sister tried killing herself multiple times through the years of my teenage development, it was so hard for me because I didn't understand she couldn't do anything about it. 

• What do you do as a job or as a career (if you have one)? Do you like it? Why or why not?

I'm a university student, I study biology. I enjoy it for the most part. I find cellular and genetic biology fascinating. I don't really like ecology for some reason.

• If you had to spend an entire weekend by yourself, how would you feel? Would you feel lonely or refreshed?

I guess I'd feel a little lonely but I don't see how this question is pertinent to cognitive functions since Jung himself had established that the terms introvert and extrovert are kind of...different by his measures. Anyways, I would feel refreshed but lonely at times. I love my family and like making time for them but I don't do it the whole day because I like to keep busy.

• What kinds of activities do you prefer? Do you like, and are you good at sports? Do you enjoy any other outdoor or indoor activities?

I used to do olympic weightlifting, that was fun. I love reading and playing the sims when I'm bored. 

• How curious are you? Do you have more ideas then you can execute? What are your curiosities about? What are your ideas about - is it environmental or conceptual, and can you please elaborate?

I can be curious but it requires a super specific interest. I tend to focus on one thing at a time if that's what you mean about the second question. My curiosities typically depend on scientific concepts (i.e. recombinant technology) and what we can do with them. I guess this is conceptual? Not sure. It can be both depending on the setting but is usually used in the laboratory to get the results we want in experiments.

• Would you enjoy taking on a leadership position? Do you think you would be good at it? What would your leadership style be?

Yes, I love organizing other people and taking over projects! I'd probably be good at it if I knew what I was getting into/had a good background knowledge. I'd say I can be very critical, but also point out people's strengths since I find people respond better to good comments than bad, and this is best for getting what I want.

• Are you coordinated? Why do you feel as if you are or are not? Do you enjoy working with your hands in some form? Describe your activity?

No, not coordinated at all sadly. Not sure, I guess I could never really do simple things like working mechanical knowledge as my plumber father. Not reaaaally? But I do enjoy lab stuff which does require my hands. So pipetting for example, you have to be precise with where you put pressure on your thumb as well as when you do gel electrophoresis (can't describe it in detail).

• Are you artistic? If yes, describe your art? If you are not particular artistic but can appreciate art please likewise describe what forums of art you enjoy. Please explain your answer.

Used to be but fell out of interest. I used to do watercolor with faces and butterflies. I loved romanticism, there's an art shop in town that I go to sometimes....I love paintings about cities, rainy days, coffee, newspapers, this is my aesthetic.

• What's your opinion about the past, present, and future? How do you deal with them?

Hmm...there's lots of things I regret in the past and wish I could change. My past was kind of sad :(. In the present I'm always trying to do things to escape it, I worry about the future but I also feel excitement towards it at times with a future career, money, and family. Future is kind of scary to me so I work to avoid this.

• How do you act when others request your help to do something (anything)? If you would decide to help them, why would you do so?

I kind of get irritiated because again, I'm busy, but I will listen. If they can do it I won't help them, but if it's someone like my mom I will help her.

• Do you need logical consistency in your life?

Yes, previous answers.

• How important is efficiency and productivity to you?

Very, very much important.

• Do you control others, even if indirectly? How and why do you do that?

Yes, I kind of subconciously take over a situation and show them what to do, where to go, how to do something, moving them along a non existant line from point a to point b. 

• What are your hobbies? Why do you like them?

Didn't I answer this already...? 

• What is your learning style? What kind of learning environments do you struggle with most? Why do you like/struggle with these learning styles? Do you prefer classes involving memorization, logic, creativity, or your physical senses?

Not sure? I think I got linguistic on one of those tests. But what I like to do is write down everything I know about a topic and fill in the missing gaps. I struggled in academia because I feel like the teachers are more research oriented and never actually got acreddited to teach in the first place, they actually sucked and never took courses at my uni for that. I prefer classes involving logic and SOME memorization, because I think you need to understand a concept and apply it in order to understnad.

• How good are you at strategizing? Do you easily break up projects into manageable tasks? Or do you have a tendency to wing projects and improvise as you go?

&#x200B;

Very very good. Yes, I break projects up into small managable tasks and go at it day by day until I am done. If I'm crunched for time (i.e. the assignment is assigned two days before due date) I will be a bit more lenient.

• What are your aspirations in life, professionally and personally?

Well, I just want to be happy. By this I mean, a good husband, kids, nice house, money. Living cmofortably. My mom and dad and sister having good health. Profesionally I want to be known in the company as someone who is hard working and to go to if you have questions, I've always been good at trainiing people.

• What are your fears? What makes you uncomfortable? What do you hate? Why?

Failure, not making anything of myself, being trapped in a condition which does not change. I hate people who whine about things they cannot change or could change, it's so immature!

• What do the ""highs"" in your life look like?

When I'm racing in my car, feeling the breeze in my hair, getting a good mark on an exam that I know specifically everyone else failed (sounds cold but it's true, I'm proud of myself). Got a good pump in at the gym, thinking about my future career or how good I'm doing in school overall.

• What do the ""lows"" in your life look like?

I sequester away from everyone, depressed and retire to my room. I become erratic with emotions and panic. 

• How attached are you to reality? Do you daydream often, or do you pay attention to what's around you? If you do daydream, are you aware of your surroundings while you do so?

I have ADHD so I do tend to day dream. I don't really pay attention to what's around me, I do get stuck in my head sometimes.

• Imagine you are alone in a blank, empty room. There is nothing for you to do and no one to talk to. What do you think about?

I go crazy. I think about all of the things I need to do for homework, how I need to study for a new exam, how I need to find primers for my genetics prof.

• How long do you take to make an important decision? And do you change your mind once you've made it?

A couple of days, I ask around for opinions and compare and contrast the pros and cons of each person before jumping in. I don't change my mind.

• How long do you take to process your emotions? How important are emotions in your life?

If I'm really upset about a test, usually a day. If it's super traumatic, obviously not alot.

Emotions are important to anyone honestly, this is a human characteristic. I wouldn't say they're ""important"" but useful...like if I cry, I'm crying because something happened. If I'm angry, I'm angry because something happened.

• Do you ever catch yourself agreeing with others just to appease them and keep the conversation going? How often? Why?

I guess only when I know they won't listen to me so it would be useless. It's not that often that I appease people this way. 

• Do you break rules often? Do you think authority should be challenged, or that they know better? If you do break rules, why?

Yes, authority should be challenged when people are bad. Other than that I color in the lines I guess."

Old_Resource_4832,ESTJ,"Hi all,

Recently I've become very intrigued by the state of matter and how it changes in response to the environment around it....how can I get into a biology masters thats chemistry oriented? Any ideas?"
Old_Resource_4832,ESTJ,"Hi there, considering going to the MSc route in chemistry. How can I do that with a BSc in chemistry and a barely 3.0 GPA from a (obviously) bad year where very bad things were happening outside of school?"
Old_Resource_4832,ESTJ,"Hello! Title says it all...I'm nearly graduating and while I absolutely love the cell, genetics, and general molecular biology/immunology...my interest has peaked again in chemistry. I took chemistry back at a community college and did terrible, but still passed (barely)....if I graduate and get a good biology job, I was tinkering around with the idea of taking the required courses to get a chem masters or just take them to add to my transcript and go into biochemistry....

That being said, is it possible to do these things during a full time adult job?

Thanks!"
