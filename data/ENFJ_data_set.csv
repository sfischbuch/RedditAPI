curiousxntpwoman,ENTP,"I'm tired of having to employ the ""secretly distrustful polite but distant"" schtick that I put up. I employ it because of previous trauma surrounding this sort of thing, where I made assumptions about the actual closeness or positivity of our interactions that turned out to just not be true with DISASTROUS results (this can trigger the hell out of us poor ENTPs with our vulnerable Fi).

How do I deal with this better without feeling psychologically utterly unsafe?  It makes me feel extremely vulnerable and unsafe to be put in a situation where someone seems disproportionately friendly for their actual level of care/closeness/etc. to me because it appears to me that the true nature of our relationship is being obscured for the ENFJ's benefit.  I'd like to sabotage my interactions with ENFJs of the good and healthy variety less frequently while avoiding a level of trust that is either too excessive or insufficient and delivering more than half of the control of the encounter to the ENFJ."
curiousxntpwoman,ENTP,"I’m an ILE with a Fi PoLR problem.  Specifically, I have difficulties telling how other people REALLY feel about me, and it’s made me into a person who keeps others at a distance to an extent that has shot me in the ass and made me miserable.

This has made me underestimate others’ positive feelings (it doesn’t make me underestimate others’ negative feelings anymore, though it used to - I overcompensate by being too cynical, however) and sabotage potential connections, has absolutely hamstrung me in the dating world, and makes me into a lonely mess who’s quite good at charming others superficially but feels she has very few actual close bonds.

How do I actually get around this and elicit cues out of others that I need to assess how they REALLY feel, particularly in socially appropriate ways, particularly if they’re not necessarily close enough that I can have an intimate conversation with them just yet?"
curiousxntpwoman,ENTP,"intp: my partners in ~~crime~~ getting stoned and binge-watching terrible shit on youtube. even if i'm pretty damn good at math, you're better at it.

entp: when i think of you, i think of three things: the 'me and the boys' meme, all of the nerd arguments you and i clog up our group chats with, and ADHD.

entj: i am in awe of your executive functioning, but you manage to not terrify me as much as estjs do.  you are the person i would be if i had more energy and the system didn't suck to the point that i stopped giving much of a fuck about working in it and instead decided to tell it to go fuck itself, imma make my own system with gigolos and blow.

intj: at your best, you are chill smart hermits. at your worst, i cannot even.

enfp: i love you, you are a quirky fun person, but dear lord try to find at least some kind of direction in life and yes you can actually operationalize and make sense out of some aspects of human emotion and identity and individuality, it's not all just ""i had this feeling!  i like this thing just because i do!"" there are underlying reasons for things and you can make sense of them and it doesn't make that feeling or value or whatever any less \*yours\*.  i do not know how to introverted feeling.

infp: at your best, you are A Marshmallow Who Should Be Protected.  at your worst, i cannot even.  i have the same criticism for you as i do for enfp, but Turned Up to 11 with More Hermiting.

enfj: i see your carefully curated and extremely active social media feed and your go-gettingness and i'm like, yo how the hell do you have the energy for that.  you make damn great mentors though.  you also have rainbows of charisma coming out your asses to the extent it kind of unnerves me and i envy you somewhat.  i can never tell how much it's just you being generally friendly and charismatic and how much it's you appreciating me specifically, pls elaborate.

infj: bless you, you sociable hermits, be less subtle and say more about yourself so i can actually understand you the way you want everybody to. also get out of the house once in a while, be adventurous every so often, and take the stick out of your butt a little more and get a little more comfortable with benign chaos.  you are wonderful. love, your roommate.

istp: i don't think i know any of you.

estp: i am you but the nerdy version. if you are a fictional character, you are usually among my favorites.  at your best, you are fun and funny as shit.  at your worst, dear god keep away from me

esfj/estj: i studiously avoid.  i feel smothered just by looking at you.

isfj/istj: your idea of fun makes me sad

curiousxntpwoman,ENTP,"This is informed by my trauma history, but does anyone else feel almost instinctively on edge around heart center types because of their image consciousness, and do we tend to be 5s, 6s, and 8s?  The underlying logic in my head usually goes “if they’re going so far as to curate their image like that, what flaws are they hiding that are so objectionable that they won’t let us see them?”

Also, what’s going on from the type 2, 3, or 4 end when they encounter someone who reacts negatively to their image concern?"

curiousxntpwoman,ENTP,"My mother was a classic deeply unhealthy 2w3 ESFJ.  It is chiefly through her actions that I have been molded into an 8w7.  She was, unsurprisingly, terrifyingly controlling and infantilizing, extremely manipulative, physically abusive sometimes, excessive in her emotional expression, and chock full of vulnerable narcissism.  She gave me crippling issues with low confidence, low self-esteem, impostor syndrome, insecurity about my competence, shame and humiliation from being infantilized, insecurity about my social skills, an EXTREME fear of losing my autonomy, a near-crippling insecurity in my own ability to wield control and a consequent tendency to experience dissociative freeze responses a lot more than I should in the face of conflict, fear of vulnerability, slowness to trust, and fears surrounding intimacy that it has taken me a long time to recover from with the help of therapy, and though I have healed much of this I am still working to heal.

I cut her and my father off three years ago for the sake of my well-being.  This, I am aware, probably traumatized the absolute shit out of her (particularly because she is a 2), but I don't give a shit - she traumatized the absolute shit out of me growing up and stole so much from me, and if she had been healthier she wouldn't have acted in a way that necessitated I do this.

How does one heal from wounds inflicted by an unhealthy 2w3 whom you have no intention of reconciling with? Input from 2s (especially 2w3s) would be especially helpful here."

VincitT,INFP,"Hey fam!  My INTP buddy is convinced that following what you love for a career kills all the joy in it.  I'm wondering you guys have any experience in this whether you went on to great success and joy or whether you just had to stop?

I know from experience I studied music after high school and it really did fall off for me, but I think there were more reasons than just having to do it a lot (ie not being able to express myself in ways I really want to like in writing/art)

Any artists (or other passion seekers) out there that that love it after a long time??"
VincitT,INFP,"Hi amazing ENFPs!  I need some help with a buddy of mine.  We were besties for half our lives and hes such an awesome dude, but he went though a really messy time with his wife (now ex) and has gone into what I think is full retreat mode from his old life. 

He was blamed heavily for what happened (and admittedly he made some poor choices) but I 100% believe how he was treated was a huge part of what led him there.  I dont blame him for what happened, but I think he blames himself a lot and through shame he has retreated from everyone who is associated with his past life.  

I want to be a support for him and help work through what happened to make sure he knows hes still a great guy and how to get past this, but I find it difficult to get him to respond much.

I have been texting him every month or two to say hi and wish him well, and only really get a response occasionally which is fine, I just want to be there for him.  I think I have insight for him that hes probably not getting from others at this point.  Hes mentioned he'd like to catch up sometime but hasn't committed to anything.  Says hes bad at responding and such

Do you guys have any ideas what I might be able to do to get back in real touch with him? I'm tempted to go full honesty and call things out but of course I dont know if hes gonna respond to that lol but we dont talk anymore anyway so I'm at the point I'd like to try anything to get that friendship back.  Honestly, I feel like I should appologize for not being a better support for him earlier when things were getting worse...

We used to click so well on a deeper level and I think he could really use a friend like that (And I totally miss him as well lol)

Let me know what you think!"
VincitT,INFP,"Hey guys, I'm a father of a cute 2 y/o munchkin who is a handful but I love him to bits!  I find I spend quite a bit of time with him as well as juggle working from home (office job blahhh) during the day.  I'm honestly super lucky i get to do that, so no real complaint there, and my wife is in the same boat so we try to support each other and trade off work/toddler time.

I have my evenings free these days, but I'm finding it so difficult to do anything other than relax and veg for a couple hours before bed.  I feel like I just want to go into recovery mode to be able to take on the next day.  I really want to get into writing a lot more, but I feel like being creative still takes effort and I fall into getting jealous of my bit of free time and end up gaming or watching a movie.

For you parents out there, when do you find time to pursue creative pursuits?  If it's at the end of the day, do you still have energy, or do you find it energizing in itself?

Thanks for being awesome!"

$600-700 CAD, Canada, as mentioned above, if i need to increase my budget, let me know.  i would much rather wait than throw money away on a machine I'm going to hate in a few months

* **Do you prefer a 2 in 1 form factor, good battery life or best specifications for the money? Pick or include any that apply.** 
 Best specs are priority

* **How important is weight and thinness to you?**
 Not super important. My last laptop was a beast and i dont mind carrying around some extra weight.  Writing in fun comfy locations is appealing though

* **Which OS do you require? Windows, Mac, Chrome OS, Linux.**
 Windows plz!

* **Do you have a preferred screen size? If indifferent, put N/A.** 
 15"" at least

* **Are you doing any CAD/video editing/photo editing/gaming? List which programs/games you desire to run.** 
 Photoshop, lightroom, might get into basic animation but only for kicks

* **If you're gaming, do you have certain games you want to play? At what settings and FPS do you want?** 
 Gaming is secondary as i have a decent desktop. Would love to play stuff like factorio, starcraft2 but not a priority

* **Any specific requirements such as good keyboard, reliable build quality, touch-screen, finger-print reader, optical drive or good input devices (keyboard/touchpad)?** 
 Good comfortable keyboard for extended writing would be awesome.  A frustrating keyboard could be a deal breaker unless a good portable plug in one is a better option

* **Leave any finishing thoughts here that you may feel are necessary and beneficial to the discussion.**
 I'm struggling to find a good laptop that will work for both. With writing, comfort is really the main concern as it doesnt have many specific requirements of the machine. Display and color is very important for the photoshop side.  I find most in this range have TN monitors?  I'm getting the impression this is something i would want to avoid

brownidegurl,ENFJ,"I'm looking for a twin mattress I can sleep on and store every day in a closet (like a shikibuton) so I can make the most of our tiny apartment space.

My husband already uses [this mattress](https://www.amazon.com/Milliard-Tri-fold-Mattress-Removable-Non-Slip/dp/B00DJ8HX96) and I've tried sleeping on it for about a week. It's fine, but I've never liked the feeling of foam mattresses and prefer spring ones for their bounce and soft feel.

brownidegurl,ENFJ,"For all the adult students out there contemplating going back to school for a career change... you can do it!

After 7 months of researching, applying, and waiting, I've been accepted to my first choice for grad school. This program is a year shorter and $20k cheaper than all the others I applied to--and perhaps even cheaper if I can swing a job there, which is likely given my higher ed work experience. 

I really needed this to pan out. The other college I applied to in my city (and that I've worked at for 5+ years, giving me a hefty employee tuition remission) summarily ended the program I currently teach in. No more job. No more remission.

During my first choice school's group interview, the chair dead-ass said, ""This year we're seeing the most competitive applicant pool ever. Not all of you will get in."" And I broke down crying. 

But I did it! This sonofabitch did it! 

Now this old lady can start the next phase of her life. Autonomy, financial solvency, and respect, here I come. 

You can do it, too. You can."
brownidegurl,ENFJ,"I've seen several posts recently couched in this language, and I'd like to reassure whoever needs to hear it: Your needs and boundaries probably don't make you an unlovable fiend.  

Also, you may find that some boundaries push others away. You get to decide what that means. Is it worth compromising your needs to keep this person in your life 24/7? Could you meet your needs and accept this person as a sometimes-friend? Or is it healthier for you to know that this person actually only likes you when they get what they want, and not you?

Perhaps these concerns about badness are another way of asking the community: ""How can I articulate my needs? Can you help me feel worthy of these boundaries?""

In which case, yes, bitches! You are worthy and we can help. And you are never an irredeemable person, even if you feel weird and needy and you did happen to do some hurtful shit once or twice or a hundred times."
brownidegurl,ENFJ,"I add four open-ended questions to my evaluations each term and thought I would share this feedback I got. Use caution if you suffer from hypertension. 

**What am I doing that helps you learn?**

Absolutely nothing, all there was to this course was failure and to drop students GPA. No matter what we did to make the assignments perfect there was always harsh critique that was way out of line.

**What could I be doing to help you learn better?**

By doing activities that would actually help the student succeed in the assignments rather than wasting 2 hours of class time doing activities that show nothing of what were supposed to do with the assignments.

**Studies show that students remember 5% of what they learned in college. What do you want to remember from COURSE201?**

Nothing because I learned nothing important to improve any skill I have in this course. This course was completely useless and did nothing but drop all students GPA, and most of the content that is taught in this course is already taught in CLASS302. So in all, this class is a waste of my tuition none.

**What advice do you have for future COURSE201 students?**

Do not take this course, if you do plan on taking it take it first to get it out of the way before you save it for last to let it hurt your GPA."

**I see you**

to all the adult students that might be lurking here. It’s been a slog—on top of working my full-time job + my extra job, I’ve basically had no free time the past 4 months, but it’s been 110% worth doing the research, current student/alumni/faculty interviews, and due diligence to ensure that these programs are worth my money and time. If you’re still in the midst of applying, keep going. It will be worth it. 

Also, this goes for everyone: It may not feel like it, but *grad school is a buyer’s market.* Almost a decade working in higher ed has shown me that you are nothing more than an open wallet and a warm, laboring body to universities. Make sure you’re getting what you pay for. That doesn’t mean demanding As from teachers because you’re “paying their salary” (please, never do this…it’s cringey and wrong-headed, since profs are getting a miniscule fraction of what you pay them lol), but do demand that your questions are answered, explore all opportunities for funding, and question anything in your program that seems sus. 

*Do your best for the people in your programs; make connections, be genuine, and follow through. Don’t assume you mean anything to “the program” or “the school.” Academia will swallow you whole and regurgitate the bones.

What is sexual attraction? I just spent half the day questioning my (demi)sexuality. I have sexual arousal and perhaps a desire for sex. But, I didn’t think I really understood sexual attraction (I’m not sure if I have any basis for it) until I had the stupid epiphany that people may be attracted to one another through sex. So, is that what sexual attraction is? Just being attracted to (i.e. wanting to be with) someone because of the sex you can have together? That definition feels both alien as well as something that seems like people would engage in, I don’t know."

Hi! I’m looking for a woman to chat/make friends with first (before any sort of romance). I normally wouldn’t look for an online relationship (surprise, surprise) but I thought I’d toss my hat in and see what happens. Hopefully you’re in California too!

I am a mixed race Filipino American in the middle of switching careers to graphic design. I will likely be getting my second degree in a year. I love cooking, linguistics, writing, art, and learning new things. I tend to like dreaming up/participating in communal projects and talking about science, space, and the future. I do hope to be a father one day.

Now for some bad stuff: I am currently partially disabled, having improved from being fully disabled a few years ago. Due to disability plus doing school, I’m not yet working enough hours in the week to support myself financially, so things are a bit of a mess on that end. But, my health is improving slowly over the years, and I do predict that things will be better after finishing school.

As for sexuality, I am heterosexual demisexual. I haven’t looked into romantic orientations so I don’t have a clue yet how to navigate that aspect. I am in the sex-indifferent/sex-positive grouping and hope to find someone of the same type.

Also, I don’t want to be awake right now! I’m being a bit of an insomniac, goodnight!"

I guess what surprised me was that I was being more asexual (if this lack of awareness of physical attractiveness is accurately asexual) than I’ve previously recognized in myself. I feel that being out and about, I probably haven’t been giving people their due. Is this a trait of asexuality or does it go by a different moniker?"

Legitimate-Safe-7424,ENFJ,"When taking 16 personalities years ago, I got ENFJ with 65% E.  I know that 16 personalities frequently mistypes and doesn't take cognitive functions into account.  That said, I have always agreed with the ENFJ profile and it seems like a good fit for me most of the time.  I just considered myself a more ambiverted ENFJ.  I do identify with some INFJ traits, but not all of it.  I really do feel like I get energy from people most of the time.

ENFJ traits I relate to:  Helping others so much I can't help myself, wanting social harmony (Fe), but also intellectualism, looking up patterns and using my intuition (Ni).  My Se was weaker as a kid but much stronger now, and I definitely suffer from overthinking (Ti inferior).

So... one day I decided to take the Sakinorva test to see if anything changed, and I got INFJ for both Grant and Myers function types, and ENFJ for Myers Briggs type.

So what exactly does that mean?  Why the INFJ for the top two results but ENFJ for the third one?  Does that mean I'm an INFJ in functions but more extroverted?  Or can I still be an ENFJ with extra Ni?"

One time we had to write an essay. Everyone wrote one, including the new girl. She had poor English skills at that time. So the essay was not upto the mark and had many grammatical mistakes. She simply wanted to write about her daily experience traveling to school by bus. But when read out aloud, it sounded weird because of lack of proper punctuation and full stop. The teacher found this essay funny. 
Next day the teacher comes in the classroom, declares what a stupid essay this new girl wrote, insults her openly for her skills and reads out the essay aloud in front of everyone. Since we were not mature enough, most students laughed at her. 
At first I didn't realize the gravity of the situation, and when I saw her face, You could see small teardrops rolling on her cheeks. I was taken aback and utterly speechless. It suddenly dawned on me what just happened. This incident broke her emotionally.
The new girl never returned to class. The last we heard, she transferred to another school.

wonder689,INFP,"So much for opening up and socialising,  lol. All my attempts to connect with people is like one embarrassing theme after another.  Time to revert back to my underground.  Alone and sad as usual."
OkayestCoffee,ENFJ,"I just tried doing a factory and for all of us some doors just didn't open and we had to back track. We got to the final silo and the final boss didn't even spawn in for me, but it did for the others: [https://i.imgur.com/QyZLdB6.jpeg](https://i.imgur.com/QyZLdB6.jpeg) 

I was trying to get some gags as well and it was a really laggy experience with other players dancing all over the room and just being weird. Everything just feels extremely sluggish like the servers are having to buffer processes or something else is going on."
OkayestCoffee,ENFJ,"For me I've been really seeking out songs that are slowed down and/or paced well with subtle emotional undertones. For the last 3-4 years I've been exclusively listening to indie folk or songs that follow the same slow build up. It's the open-ended story ones I love the most where I can fill in the gaps with what's going on around me or some major even happening at the same time. Any song that can bring out complicated conflicting emotions just makes me put it on repeat 24/7. These are my go-to songs right now:

[1957 - Milo Greene](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8Mc8YRigmw)

[I Will Remain - Matthew and the Atlas](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvZJEdA1rMQ)

[Yellow Light - Of Monsters and Men](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBlKPLeLU_s)

Wondering if you all do something similar or entirely different and what you are listening to right now."
OkayestCoffee,ENFJ,"I'm a May 2020 grad and because of the pandemic decided to delay grad school until 2022 and take classes at a local CC during the interim while working to save up some money. So far I've managed to do very well during covid and have landed a really lucrative position as a sort of support designer in a large firm.

That said now that I got my covid vaccine with stuff opening back up and have a stupid amount of free time, I want to get more involved in voluntary work. I preferably would like to do something that lets me use the skills I've developed in school/work while being able to translate it into an addition to my portfolio/resume/grad school applications. I'm wondering if anyone else here has done something similar or knows of something they wish they had done.

Something I've been considering is when K-12 schools / libraries open back up, I would like to teach basic afterschool CAD/Design courses to like elementary or middle school kids. I love teaching and with running a small business that utilizes 3D printers I would have a blast bringing that to a class out of my own pocket. Plus it's how I got my start with my first arch professor being in my Junior/Senior year of high school and he took out time from his own practice to come teach us."
kaguragamer,ENFJ,"Prob gonna get quite a few but the stereotype is that we'd be self sacrificial to the point where we would die for you, that we're the people jumping up and down on school hallways and greeting everyone or we'd be extremely popular everywhere and be everyone's ultimate therapist and getting people to open up everytime. 

For me I'd resemble something like an INTP , when I was in childhood because of extra domineering parents before finally finding myself when I was slightly older, but even then, the stereotyping on the subreddit especially the mbti official one got me thinking if you guys had a similar experience too"

kaguragamer,ENFJ,"since nobody uses both, instead of revamping each of them or one of them , just combine the two hero skills into one and its bound to be broken af"
kaguragamer,ENFJ,"So need help typing my bro, he's a hard one to type for sure:

\- Tries to fake indifference but he secretly cares a lot for stuff

\- He can be super extroverted around friends but around family and unfamiliar people, he tends to behave extremely quiet and another self

\- He is not an avid fan of doing stuff like sports with others not because he hates the company, but because he fears he is not good at them and will get laughed at. 

\-  Expanding on the previous point, he tends to have an avoidance for performing in front of people without what he calls ""sufficient preperation"" which probably takes forever for him if he doesn't receive a small push

\- Loves reading up on interesting topics and regurgitating information

\- Generally avoids conflict, if people ask him for a request that he knows he would not like, he'd try to push it off with something like ""I'd consider"" and then avoid replying further or come with an excuse.

\- Extremely entertaining and comes up with funny stories or jokes most of the time

\- Gets along with people extremely well, might be quiet at first, but stick him with a person for a week and he'd become the most lively person you'd ever meet. 

\- Cannot do something without a plan at all. He makes sure that things are planned out for important events or stuff so if you stick him on stage to make a speech impromptu and stuff he would be extremely awkward. 

\-Tends to hold in his anger until a breaking point where it can explode

\- He's the nicest guy you would ever meet, might seem a little sarcastic and edgy at first, but in reality, he's a softie and would come to you whenever your in need."
kaguragamer,ENFJ,"Holy shit, the amount of movement speed and physical pen this item does is so insane that every hero that does physical damage can use it. Its literally a claude skill one for the rest of the enemies, and with malefic roar it completely cancels out any physical PEN provided with warrior boots and the such. Anyone notices this? Or is it just me? The movemen speed provided with this item is just so insane"
obelixthegaul,INTP,"Hello ISTPs. I (33M) have an ISTP (24F) neighbour who I am developing feelings for. 

We've lived next to each other for a couple of years and spoken here and there (usually to co-ordinate weed), but the last couple of months we've been hanging out more often. We eat pizza and watch movies or listen to music and chat about stuff until early hours of the morning.

We have also started sharing things about our lives with each other; eg, she had some annoying drama with some friends that I gave her advice on, she tells me about mental health struggles she has, and she consoled me when my dad died recently.

She came out of a long term relationship a few months ago and is still single, stays home 7 days a week except for work and as far as I know, no other dudes are hanging out with her.

With the data out of the way: problem is, we are both IxTPs and I have no idea whether this is just casual and friendly for her, or she might be developing feelings too. Probably, she has no idea about mine either, because I don't flirt either, even though I have to suppress imagining all the things I would do to her if I got the chance whenever we're together.

It's not as simple as ""just ask"" because we're neighbours, and I do value her friendship so I don't want to jump the gun or break things.

My questions for you are: a) does the fact that she wants to chill frequently, and opens up about the inside of her head, increase the odds that the feelings are mutual or does it indicate nothing?

And b) if a friend expresses feelings that you don't reciprocate how likely are you to pull back from the friendship?"
obelixthegaul,INTP,"Hello wonderful people. It was my birthday recently and every year, my INFP ex from 20 years ago remembers and wishes me a happy birthday. I don't have my birthday listed on social media, she just remembers and reaches out. Even when the last message between us was me wishing her a happy birthday six months earlier. 

She's such a sweetie and is the only non-family to remember or say anything. It doesn't bother me that others don't, but it's very sweet that she does."

zi0nl,INTP,I’ll start it off.. I guess you could say I’m the smartest idiot you’ll ever meet 😂

VousMintriguez,ENTP,"The question I've been asking myself is why am I so unable to focus on one thing. I mean, who the fuck studies Mandarin, accounting, taxation law, calculus and French translation at the same time? I used to be single-minded like an INTJ with a single-purpose drive and then something happened. I scattered all over the map sometime in my mid twenties. Is ENTP a shadow function of another type?"
HovercraftWaste8983,ENFJ,"I ranked the presidents by what their weight would be on earth's moon. I will include a link to the spreadsheet I made with the presidents' weights on both earth and the moon if anyone would like to reference it. This is my first post on Reddit btw, I'm excited:) If people enjoy this, I'll make one for weights on mars.

Note: President Biden was not included in the template, but he would fall between George Washington and Barack Obama at 29.54 lbs.

If anyone has any questions, feel free to ask! This was so much fun!

HovercraftWaste8983,ENFJ,"Hi guys! Fellow ENFJ here. I'm a senior in high school and I am completely unsure about what career I'd like to pursue. For a long time I thought that I wanted to be an engineer, but I love helping people and don't know if I would feel fulfilled in that profession. I love helping people, working with kids with special needs, and being a leader. However, I am also great at academics and know I could pursue anything if I worked hard enough. What do you guys do for a living? Do you enjoy it? Any regrets? Any advice? I'd love to hear your thoughts. Thank you <3"
