mootmoot1111,INFJ,"You guys gotta know your power and understand that you're allowed to take up space regardless of what the outside would be telling you.
Also it's ok to be associated with stuff with negative connotations to it or be afraid of the unknown. Change that mindset into faith in the unknown. The unknown will always be there regardless of what you do or feel, so accept your fears and coddle your strengths. Be good to yourself.
Let yourself be aware and freed from the shackles for at least a day and you'll see it all come together."
mootmoot1111,INFJ,"I think black holes just strip one dimension from what ever enters it. So 2D is 1D and 3D is 2D, but does that mean 4D beings become visible to us when they enter a black hole?

mootmoot1111,INFJ,"I think the Mandela effect happens because of the 5th dimension coming into contact with the 4D which alters our spatial 3D timeline, but when something is solid in the 3D, the 5D only alters what is existing in the moment and not our memories of it. That's why we get confused after seeing something but remembering it differently... does this mean the 5D is slowly gaslighting us? üò≥"

curiousxntpwoman,ENTP,"I'm tired of having to employ the ""secretly distrustful polite but distant"" schtick that I put up. I employ it because of previous trauma surrounding this sort of thing, where I made assumptions about the actual closeness or positivity of our interactions that turned out to just not be true with DISASTROUS results (this can trigger the hell out of us poor ENTPs with our vulnerable Fi).

How do I deal with this better without feeling psychologically utterly unsafe?  It makes me feel extremely vulnerable and unsafe to be put in a situation where someone seems disproportionately friendly for their actual level of care/closeness/etc. to me because it appears to me that the true nature of our relationship is being obscured for the ENFJ's benefit.  I'd like to sabotage my interactions with ENFJs of the good and healthy variety less frequently while avoiding a level of trust that is either too excessive or insufficient and delivering more than half of the control of the encounter to the ENFJ."
curiousxntpwoman,ENTP,"I‚Äôm an ILE with a Fi PoLR problem.  Specifically, I have difficulties telling how other people REALLY feel about me, and it‚Äôs made me into a person who keeps others at a distance to an extent that has shot me in the ass and made me miserable.

This has made me underestimate others‚Äô positive feelings (it doesn‚Äôt make me underestimate others‚Äô negative feelings anymore, though it used to - I overcompensate by being too cynical, however) and sabotage potential connections, has absolutely hamstrung me in the dating world, and makes me into a lonely mess who‚Äôs quite good at charming others superficially but feels she has very few actual close bonds.

How do I actually get around this and elicit cues out of others that I need to assess how they REALLY feel, particularly in socially appropriate ways, particularly if they‚Äôre not necessarily close enough that I can have an intimate conversation with them just yet?"
curiousxntpwoman,ENTP,"intp: my partners in ~~crime~~ getting stoned and binge-watching terrible shit on youtube. even if i'm pretty damn good at math, you're better at it.

entp: when i think of you, i think of three things: the 'me and the boys' meme, all of the nerd arguments you and i clog up our group chats with, and ADHD.

entj: i am in awe of your executive functioning, but you manage to not terrify me as much as estjs do.  you are the person i would be if i had more energy and the system didn't suck to the point that i stopped giving much of a fuck about working in it and instead decided to tell it to go fuck itself, imma make my own system with gigolos and blow.

intj: at your best, you are chill smart hermits. at your worst, i cannot even.

enfp: i love you, you are a quirky fun person, but dear lord try to find at least some kind of direction in life and yes you can actually operationalize and make sense out of some aspects of human emotion and identity and individuality, it's not all just ""i had this feeling!  i like this thing just because i do!"" there are underlying reasons for things and you can make sense of them and it doesn't make that feeling or value or whatever any less \*yours\*.  i do not know how to introverted feeling.

infp: at your best, you are A Marshmallow Who Should Be Protected.  at your worst, i cannot even.  i have the same criticism for you as i do for enfp, but Turned Up to 11 with More Hermiting.

enfj: i see your carefully curated and extremely active social media feed and your go-gettingness and i'm like, yo how the hell do you have the energy for that.  you make damn great mentors though.  you also have rainbows of charisma coming out your asses to the extent it kind of unnerves me and i envy you somewhat.  i can never tell how much it's just you being generally friendly and charismatic and how much it's you appreciating me specifically, pls elaborate.

infj: bless you, you sociable hermits, be less subtle and say more about yourself so i can actually understand you the way you want everybody to. also get out of the house once in a while, be adventurous every so often, and take the stick out of your butt a little more and get a little more comfortable with benign chaos.  you are wonderful. love, your roommate.

istp: i don't think i know any of you.

estp: i am you but the nerdy version. if you are a fictional character, you are usually among my favorites.  at your best, you are fun and funny as shit.  at your worst, dear god keep away from me

esfj/estj: i studiously avoid.  i feel smothered just by looking at you.

isfj/istj: your idea of fun makes me sad

esfp: DRAAAAAAAAAAMAAAAAAA

curiousxntpwoman,ENTP,"My mother was a classic deeply unhealthy 2w3 ESFJ.  It is chiefly through her actions that I have been molded into an 8w7.  She was, unsurprisingly, terrifyingly controlling and infantilizing, extremely manipulative, physically abusive sometimes, excessive in her emotional expression, and chock full of vulnerable narcissism.  She gave me crippling issues with low confidence, low self-esteem, impostor syndrome, insecurity about my competence, shame and humiliation from being infantilized, insecurity about my social skills, an EXTREME fear of losing my autonomy, a near-crippling insecurity in my own ability to wield control and a consequent tendency to experience dissociative freeze responses a lot more than I should in the face of conflict, fear of vulnerability, slowness to trust, and fears surrounding intimacy that it has taken me a long time to recover from with the help of therapy, and though I have healed much of this I am still working to heal.

I cut her and my father off three years ago for the sake of my well-being.  This, I am aware, probably traumatized the absolute shit out of her (particularly because she is a 2), but I don't give a shit - she traumatized the absolute shit out of me growing up and stole so much from me, and if she had been healthier she wouldn't have acted in a way that necessitated I do this.

How does one heal from wounds inflicted by an unhealthy 2w3 whom you have no intention of reconciling with? Input from 2s (especially 2w3s) would be especially helpful here."

Curious, and it‚Äôd be cool to know what kind of student you were. I was known for being nice, funny, weird, and many people liked my artistic skills. Had average grades and popularity with a lot of friends but i only talk to 1 best friend that I truly enjoy and feel comfortable with.

ALes03,INFJ,"I get sick of being a people-pleaser because of my Fe, and how understanding and open-minded I generally am. When I‚Äôm fed up with people who always bully me, I go into loop and being in the loop helps me use Ti more. I don‚Äôt use Ti much because Fe is in the way. 

People I care would always start to listen to me more because I‚Äôm more realistic and confident, but also intimidating. They never listen to me or acknowledge my opinions and existence whenever I‚Äôm not in loop, and Thinkers always start to admire me more too, but Feelers fear me. I tend to have doubt and overthinking issues, but it‚Äôs the opposite in loop, and it reliefs a lot of stress. I also don‚Äôt really worry how others feel about me and it feels great, like refreshing?... Ngl, I do like to verbal abuse the people who hurt me, especially when they‚Äôve always mistreated me in the past and I just let them do so (sometimes). Loop and the people themselves give me the opportunity to change myself and mistreat them. I always wish they understand why and how I became like this but I know they don‚Äôt care enough to analyze such.

Again, it‚Äôs me being fed up by society which lead me to either the loop, rage, Se grip, or ESTP shadow. I wish I can be in the loop more. It only happens like once every few months or so, because I‚Äôm a moderate healthy and unhealthy INFJ who always vents too much as a way to relief pain.

Just venting and expressing my thoughts and opinions.

**Edit:** i made a [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/infj/comments/ltffjq/people_always_dont_take_my_emotions_seriously/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;utm_name=iossmf) long ago about people starting to care when it‚Äôs too late, and this relates too."
ALes03,INFJ,"**TL;DR:** People stress me out, refuse to talk to me, they judge me based on who i am and how i look.

I‚Äôve said this many times in reddit about this, and yeah, my classmates, relatives, and even strangers give me strange looks and/or refuse to talk to me just because of those 2 reasons I mentioned in title.

I‚Äôm venting right now about my recent situation how two of my close relatives asked my close cousin if I‚Äôm a lesbian just because I don‚Äôt talk about guys, but they legit never ask me any questions because of my aura. They‚Äôre afraid of talking to me, and they‚Äôve asked everyone their relationships except me, and I 100% don‚Äôt mind answering *any personal questions* they‚Äôre curious about. It annoys me because they‚Äôre judging me, and they‚Äôve seen me smiling and laughing almost as much as they do, but they don‚Äôt take note on things I get offended by that triggers me, such as inequality and criticism, so they shouldn‚Äôt be afraid of me. The things you care about matters because it tells you who you are but no one cares enough to want to understand you. They would always make their own judgments without communicating.

People tell me to smile but i always tell them i only smile if I‚Äôm genuinely happy; fake smiles is exhausting, though i did used to do that in middle school. Becoming more sociable is impossible for me because i get tired easily because of my empathic ability or just being an INFJ in general to summarize it. Probably gonna delete this, idk."

ALes03,INFJ,"This happen mostly with my close relations and it‚Äôs usually when I tell them to stop harassing me but they don‚Äôt until 30 min later, when i‚Äôve already been upset and aloof, and now they ask me what‚Äôs wrong. It makes me sick how they care for me *now* and not *before*. Whenever i become toxic to them after that, they‚Äôd always think badly of me and ask why im angry all of a sudden, but if they acknowledged me sooner, they would‚Äôve at least understand me better without assuming I‚Äôm just ‚Äúthrowing a random tantrum‚Äù.

ALes03,INFJ,I always feel bad when I vent my problems to my close INFP friend and I always apologize for being a nuisance but she told me she loves listening and is the nosy type so that‚Äôs kind of reassuring.

idkabettername,ENTP,"I do not know where to start. You are intelligent logically socially and creativity. Are able to focus on one vision to change the world which is admirable. As well as your care for the current and future generations. You are more empathetic then I will ever be and are very friendly and charming. You are willing to help anybody not matter what and your NiTi intellgence combined with your Fe charm is inspirarional. You are also very cute and the exact person I'd want to cuddle and I generally do not like physical contact. You keep me focused organised when I forgot those thing and unlike most J types actually motivate me to continue like that. You are generally very well balanced and have a good sense of humour. Your deeper and more introspective than I will ever be. You laugh at all the unfunny things I say and beleive anything I say is possible (even if it is not) you have a good sense of humour and I always want to learn more about your super fascinating brains. It sometimes feels like you are 1000 years ahead of us. You never show it all are the start so exploring your brain is like exploring a woods just more fascinating.

shinnik,INFJ,"Just crossed my mind, it would be interesting to have a day for all INFJs where we can celebrate our INFJness :)) May be we can wear a similar t-shirts with our slogan or something, so we can identify/find each other in the wild.

Why?
1. This is our way to find people like us and unite. 
2. People don't understand us or who we are - maybe once they know they'll understand, value & appreciate us more.
3. Lots of people don't know that they are INFJs and think that there is something wrong with them - this way they'll find out that there is nothing wrong with them - we just wired differently.

4...5...6...7...8...

And I can go on and on and on."
shinnik,INFJ,"I think explanation is very simple - we are emotionally dry. We are very logical people and everything we do being filtered through our logic - even our emotions.

Usually people want to feel emotions from other people for the connection between people to happen. And we just don't have enough of that emotional energy to attract anyone on a long term. All our energy goes to logical part of us and very little being supplied to our emotional part. So we are very careful when we use that emotional energy and most of the time we waste it on people we know and then go to hibernation mode to recharge it. And if we get emotionally attached to someone that emotional energy is just draining from us nonstop and there is nothing left for anyone, I guess that's why door slam is very common for INFJs because this is our way to emotionally disconnect from that person to stop our emotional energy bleeding."
shinnik,INFJ,For some reason I feel like this TV Series is about how INFJs (alient/main character) are being perceived by other people and just making fun of our INFJ group. Or maybe I am over analyzing things?
KickPlane,INFJ,"I‚Äôm not very experienced socially. 

I had a lonely-upbringing because I wouldn‚Äôt get on the same level as my classmates. I would rather play by myself making up all sorts of fantastical adventures. I was labeled ‚Äúvery quiet‚Äù and some actually thought I was mute! The truth was, I was just busy venturing through my mind.

Younger me didn‚Äôt make friendships a priority. I thought, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt need friends. My academics and my imagination are the top. Everyone else is busy with meaningless things.‚Äù

It took a toll on me. 

The lack of proper socializing slightly stunted me. I heavily preferred to keep quiet so I wouldn‚Äôt say anything awkward like an idiot. I‚Äôm not experienced at verbal communication. My words are fragmented, jumbled, and sometimes mumbled out.

I was an awkward mess in middle school. I let people take advantage of me because I didn‚Äôt want to come across as rude or condescending. I was a doormat and I really thought I was fine because then people wouldn‚Äôt be upset at me if I abided to them or stayed quiet.

KickPlane,INFJ,"I can become very emotional when exposed to certain things. On the contrary, sometimes I underreact to things.

I can‚Äôt bear to put up with Hypochondria anymore. It‚Äôs getting worse and worse and I can‚Äôt fight it solo anymore. I need help as soon as possible.

There are some pretty major life changes going on as well and it makes my mind race. I feel like I‚Äôm going to break down and cry and I think I‚Äôm losing time."
KickPlane,INFJ,"Me and my family went to Sunday church when I was an itty bitty child (7 or so) we stopped going after attending several visits. The reason? I don‚Äôt know.

Now, many years later, my mother wants us to try going back to church. She wants us to try it out again so we can better connect with God. I know she was expecting a positive response from me but I reacted the opposite way. Instead, all of this made my anxiety rise to high levels. This is a big deal to me and knowing it‚Äôs happening again makes me shake and want to cry. I just feel very very afraid, hesitant, and mixed about church.

I suffer from persistent Hypochondria and senses of dread and impending doom. I believe these are some of the major factors contributing to my feelings towards going to church.

Edit: There had been a change of plans, so me and my family will be going to church next week. For those of you interested, I will make a follow-up post when next Sunday comes. :)"
KickPlane,INFJ,"I am an INFJ and she is an ENFP.

Yesterday, we were talking about anime stuff. And to lightly tease her, I called her ‚Äúthe weebiest weeb‚Äù because I knew how much enthusiasm she had about anime. Everything went downhill from then on. I could somehow sense growing annoyance in her texts, and in turn, my responses became fueled with annoyance. 

We had a small argument and I realized how it was spiraling down towards negativity so I tried to put a stop to it. Afterwards, she told me how me calling her that made her slightly insulted. But, she knew I was only joking around and it was just that she wasn‚Äôt used to being the one on the receiving end of the teasing. It makes sense because, most of the time, she‚Äôs the one teasing me.

We turned the entire conversation around and started talking about some other things, but I still feel a sense of guilt from letting myself be loose enough to tease her. When I‚Äôm loose, I tend to joke around and tease people more to show them that I‚Äôm becoming comfortable. This situation makes me feel the need to lock that side behind closed doors."

KlokasGang,INFJ,"I've realized that in my approach to memories I remember things sort of from a detached perspective, I'm pretty much unable to recall the entire *vibe* so to say. For example I'll remember *that* I felt a certain way, but I can't remember *how* it felt.

Unless there's some kind of a sensory trigger. A song, a smell, a taste, and associated memories will flood back like a punch in the face. It forces the entire vibe of a memory into me in a way that I can't usually feel. If it's a bad memory it can be VERY unpleasant, but even if it's not, just viscerally feeling something that's lost to time is what I can only describe as...eerie. 

It makes me wonder if this is the way high Si users always remember things. For me it's something more occasional that attacks me and throws off my equilibrium. I can't relate to positive nostalgia because of this, when it's triggered it's just too emotionally intense for my liking, basically being exposed to the memories I usually don't have access to all at once, concentrated. 

I'm curious, is this something you other INFJs can relate to?"

TehJimmyy,INFJ,"I have a i5 2500k + gtx 970 g1 edition + 1333Mhz Rams .

I play Apex Legends in 72 hz 1080p and want to move to 1080p 144hz ( low - competitive settings ) since the game runs on 100fps and stutters  a lot due to cpu being 100 % all the time.

Will buy a AOC 24G2U sometime this year ( 240 $ )

Should i go for:

5600x ( 450 $ greece )

MSI Mortar B550M ( 180 $ )

2x8 GB Ram Ripjaws 3200 Mhz ( 80 $ )

and get a 3060 Ti when i get the rest of the money this summer when GPUs price go down

or wait and get a 3600 ( 260 $ ) now and get 3060 non ti later when it releases ? I am worried the 3600 bottlenecks the 3060 Ti (  660$ now) in 1080p so i am not considering -10 % gains.

or wait completely till summer and grab 5600x+3060 Ti at better prices hopefully ?

My budget now is 730 $

TehJimmyy,INFJ,"Hello guys,

I need your opinions on my upgrade decision. Currently i sit on a i5 2500k + GTX 970 and i want to  upgrade my processor since it bottlenecks my 970 on Apex Legends  and stutters a lot on 72Hz with ddr3 1333mhz Ram. I want to play Apex in the future at 1080p 144hz competitive and maybe do some light editing or 3d projects on blender.

This is what i plan to do to upgrade my CPU first then maybe grab an RTX 3060 later. My budget is around 700 $.

CPU: Ryzen 5600 X ( 390 $ in greece with VAT )

Motherboard: According to this video and VRMs [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxczZChFaZI&t=921s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxczZChFaZI&t=921s) i plan between MSI B550 Gaming Plus or give some extra cash for the better Tomahawk VRMs ? ( 170 $ - 200 $ )

RAM:

G.Skill TridentZ Neo 16GB DDR4-3600MHz (F4-3600C16D-16GTZNC) ( 130 $  )

RGB looks nice and i plan to get a Kolink Stronghold Case with glass so it would look nice

or

G.Skill Flare X 16GB DDR4-3200MHz (F4-3200C14D-16GFX) ( 120 $)

This is B-Die and according to this video [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FB\_8zXW46Jw&t=127s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FB_8zXW46Jw&t=127s) if i tune the timings i will get better FPS to the rgb kits. Is it worth the risk to take this kit and OC it to 3600 Mhz - 3800 and Infinity fabric to half ( is 1900 IF guaranteed?) to get the 10-20 % better perfomance to the kit ? Because if it doesnt OC well i saw on Youtube benchmarks the 3600 cl 16 XMP gets more frames than 3200 Cl 14 even thought the 14/3200 < 16/3600 latency is lower which i find weird.

or get a 4000 Mhz cl 18 ripjaws kit same price.

TehJimmyy,INFJ,"I was playing my first  trios game today with some casual randoms as always. We land dropship then we fight some teams around. One of them was 2 already evo stacked predator players ( thanks matchmaking ) and they down my 2 teammates while i disengage and heal. 

One teammate with his mic proceeds to speak something seriously along these lines: 

""We are gonna give you a chance to recover our banner"" 

I type like ""ok"" in chat and i am like what the fuck.

Then he says: ""Ok man last chance before i leave"" .

TehJimmyy,INFJ,"I took a online test yesterday on 16personalities and the results were the ""Logician' type who are typically introverts who have significant amount of emotional apathy and are usually thinkers all the time who always like to plan ahead and make everything perfect. Those people rely heavily on validation of others and care too much of their opinion and fear rejection more than others.

This resonated heavily with me even thought i have done some cold approaches that led nowhere but i still find it very hard from time to time . Sometimes i dont bother talking to people in college i know even if they are next to me due to that or being busy in my own mind.

What i liked that i read and was thinking about lately is it said that we can make ourselves more ""approachable"" or leave ""bait"" after the initial approach so people can do the hard work for us.

I am interested  if is this approach worked for you as introverts and found something efficient.

epnds,INFJ,"My fellow mbti enthusiasts! Who are some of your favorite INFJ characters out there (from books, movies, television, cartoons, anime, etc.) that display traits of the INFJ type? and why?

I'll start: Itachi Uchiha from Naruto because he's overall just a badass. Cares deeply for his family, but more so for the fate of humanity due to wiping out his entire clan for plotting the demise of the entire village. He is extremely emotional on an intellectual level, and justifies his actions through expressing his feelings of self defeat, but also his determination for world peace. He is a perfectionist to a tee and possesses one of the strongest (if not THE strongest) genjutsu -- illusionary techniques -- in the entire series. He then passes on his abilities to his beloved younger brother. Itachi is one of the most intense, well-written and primal characters in the series.

epnds,INFJ,"Hi, I am somewhat new to understanding reddit. I don't exactly know what drew me to finding this subreddit in the first place, other than my odd obsession with MBTI at the moment. But this kind of thing existing is pretty damn cool to me. Anyways, my name is Ez. I am a multi-instrumentalist producer & private music instructor for violin, guitar, and piano. After graduating from music school, I started teaching young people, primarily children, who were interested in beginning music. I love my job, but it has started to burn me out after 2 years. My primary aspiration is to be working in the film industry as a music producer and composer, but lately I have been more so driven to just make personal music and be a songwriter. 

The fact that I am here writing this now is different for me because although I have many friends and acquaintances IRL, I often feel misunderstood by the bulk of my peers. The only person I have felt a true connection with has been my girlfriend of 8 years (who is an INTJ if that matters to anyone haha). This relationship has been a blessing and a curse, however. We became so close to the point that I became so deeply involved with the idea of a perfect relationship. Her career has taken off full-throttle while I am still working at figuring myself out. Now it seems as though I've lost touch in myself, as well as some of my passions... and we are both deciding to take a break from one another for some time. 

I currently live in GA and I love to travel. Places I have been include: Japan, Greece, Canada, and only a few states on the east coast of USA (I have flown to LA but i've only been to the airport lol...). I have been kinda obsessed with Japanese culture for as long as I can remember. Right now all I can think about is Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba. I fucking love the characters... As a child I always loved drawing my own anime characters and rewriting OP & BGM theme song lyrics. This may have drawn me to become a musician. 

I don't really want to write a whole life story here, but if anyone who is an INFJ is interested in relating with my personal interests then I would be so excited to chat about video games, anime, art, music, life, philosophy, more or less deeper things of interest. I've never gone outside of my comfort zone in this regard, so it excites me to meet others who might share similar experiences to me on a personality basis.

hehe lesgooooo wooooo"

Peripeteia2020,INFJ,"I just want him to know how much he means to me. He was sinking lower and lower last year, and ended up completely withdrawing in mid-December. Before he disappeared, he lashed out at me and said some hurtful things to me which were way out of character for him. Since then, my calls go straight to voicemail and he doesn't reply to my emails. I send him regular mail but he doesn't reply to that either. Last week I was finally able to confirm that he's still alive, at least.

Now *I'm* falling into depression, worrying abt him and also abt the status of our friendship. Our city is finally emerging from pandemic restrictions, and I was looking forward to enjoying it with him. I don't want him to know the extent of my sadness, but is there any way for me to tell him that life's not the same without him? Or is that selfish of me to say?"
Peripeteia2020,INFJ,"Of the many that I've tested, there are two that really work for me (both are for Android):

Secret of Happiness ([https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.soh&hl=en\_US&gl=US](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.soh&hl=en_US&gl=US)) is a gratitude journal with a very simple format.  You set a reminder for sometime in the morning, and jot down three things you're grateful for plus something you're looking forward to during the day.  Another reminder sometime in the evening prompts you to input something positive that happened during the day.  It really does retrain your brain to start looking for the positive.  You will probably notice improvements in your mood after just a week of daily use--especially if, like me, mornings are the hardest part of your day.  Oh, this app also allows you to set a password!

Meditation Music (the one by Craftsman Spirit: [https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=yoga.meditation.yogamusic.meditationmusic&hl=en\_US&gl=US](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=yoga.meditation.yogamusic.meditationmusic&hl=en_US&gl=US)) is another simple app that has pre-recorded loops of ambient music for relaxation.  Each selection uses prolonged chords and tones that subconsciously cause you to take longer, deeper breaths and have a slower heart rate.  I usually feel the effects after about 20 minutes, even if I'm doing something else at the same time like reading a book or washing the dishes.  The free version has a very generous selection to choose from so you can find just the right ""vibe"" (sometimes adjusting the volume helps too).  There's even a timer so you can use the app to help you fall asleep.  The app continues to play even if your phone locks or if you use another app simultaneously.

But I'm always down to talk to my ENFP friend, because he goes deep but also off on interesting tangents. ENFPs will talk abt current events and then philosophy, then tie it to something they saw in a movie, which relates to something else that happened to them 10 or 12 years ago. And any subject conjures their big ENFP feelings. My friend stops and says ""I'm talking too much, aren't I?"" And I wanna say to him, ""Don't stop. Please, don't stop.""

Vivid_Awareness_4057,INFJ,"So today I came across this iPhone App called Dimensional, a new science-based form of personality testing that I think came out just back in December. I was intrigued because it has a 5-star rating, and all the reviews are fantastic, so I decided to give it a go.

And oh my god, it is exactly what I needed.

It provided me so much clarity and gave me incredible insight into all the ""dimensions"" (haha) of my personality. Yeah, I do loosely type myself as INFJ (and this test reflected that better than any test I have taken so far), but this app gave me so much more than four letters, and it was really attuned to my unique traits and values. Highly highly HIGHLY recommend!!!

I encourage you (iPhone users only, sorry Android but they are still working on it) to check it out and let me know what y'all think!

Edit: also I know I said INFJs, but I encourage all types to try it! INFJs especially tho, because we are some very confused paradoxical and nonsensical beings.

Vivid_Awareness_4057,INFJ,"Hi guys,

So I took a Big 5 Personality Test (Openness to experience, conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness, natural reactions) and I thought I would share my results and hear your thoughts. I took a few tests recently and started noticing that I fit really well in the infj type, although for a long time, I thought I was isfj (tbh I was never really satisfied with this typing). Sometimes I think I am an infj, but then as soon as I read a new thread, I second guess myself again. Is this normal for infj to question themselves and not easily accept they are an infj? I am afraid if I start telling people I am an infj, people will not believe me. I have always felt like I don't really have anyone in my life who completely gets my personality, and I get frustrated when people try to categorize me, as I am never satisfied with their assessments. Anyway, in my quest to better understanding myself, I am sharing my results for the Big 5 test. I would really appreciate your insights!

My results:

Vivid_Awareness_4057,INFJ,"EDIT: alright so we clarified the Goo-Logan connection (detailed in the comments below). It's amazing how the author is so subtle when it comes to these things, but the connections are always there! That's what I love so much about this story! They always prompt me to have more questions, and crave for answers!

Questions I have now:

 \- Did Goo and Gun fight? Is that how Gun got those scars? When was this talked about in the story?

 \- Goo says he has a successor in the Workers crew (Runaway Fam: Epilogue). Who is it?

 \- Both Jake Kim and Johan Seong were removed from their leader positions by Gun, and now they both want to kill him. Something tells me that everything happening within the 4 major crews is going to lead back to Gun, for better or for worse.

 \- DG knows Daniel's secret?! And we still don't know why. Daniel is told by Charles Choi he has to surpass DG, and then he will know the secret to his two bodies. Is DG the final boss, after Daniel destroys the 4 major crews?

Obviously some of these questions still aren't answered, but I'm open to starting discussions and sharing thoughts and ideas!

OP: Y'all I'm rereading Lookism (because I love it so much but I was kinda getting all the characters mixed up so I needed to clarify the character relationships especially the Big 4 crews) and I just finished rereading the God Dog arc. The one thing I can't seem to remember is when did Logan first meet Gun and Goo? When Gun shows up to ""disqualify"" Johan Logan recognizes him as being with Goo. I vaguely remember this but I can't remember when they met and what they talked about. Can anyone point me to the chapter or describe their encounter?

I know it's a small detail lol but it's bugging me. I'm going crazy ;).

I'm testing this Friday, and I feel like I am running out of CARS passages. I have already gone through the CARS question packs at least twice now, and I have one more AAMC practice test left (FL4), which I'll be taking tomorrow.

I'm looking for more AAMC-like CARS practice before Friday. I found JW passages to be helpful, although I am not sure whether I should keep doing that until Friday since it is not official CARS practice. My impression of JW is that it is quite similar to AAMC and I am still practicing the same critical thinking skills, although sometimes the questions can be hit or miss. I worked through all the KA passages on his website, which were also pretty helpful.

I think I am getting to a good place with CARS (trying to score btwn 128-130), but I feel like if I stop practicing at some point, I will forget my strategies and do poorly.

Anyone have any advice regarding where I can find more AAMC CARS practice for these last few days?"

First, you need a problem. A problem that grips you so that you feel a desire to investigate. The next thing you need to do is have something to say about the issue. And reading is brilliant for that. You should read as much as you can about how to address the problem you have.

Now you have new information at your disposal, and it‚Äôs your job to elegantly formulate that - while being precise in your word choice. You then organize your sentences correctly. And your paragraphs. Hopefully, now the whole thing is coherent enough to make sense.

While this is happening, you are sharpening your tools and integrating your personality at the highest and most abstract level of organization. You‚Äôre learning to think. And you improve your ability to think by learning to write. Pick some severe problems and learn to write very, very carefully.

If you are a competent writer, speaker - communicator - you have all of the authority and competence that there is.

Some of the most amazing writers I‚Äôve seen have been INFJs. I‚Äôve also noticed that a lot of us struggle with verbalising our thoughts and therefore have trouble with people misunderstanding us. I think writing is the gateway for us. Once we learn to formulate the web of insights in our brains, it translates so beautifully on paper and helps us connect with the world better. I personally have been trying to avoid getting into writing but at this point I think it‚Äôs imperative. 

What are your thoughts?"
PrincessTeex,ENFJ,"Do any INFJ women desire to be a homemaker/housewife and don‚Äôt feel like the don‚Äôt fit into the ‚Äúboss babe‚Äù/ career women archetype (or women who are SAHMs already). I‚Äôm 22 and just graduated and I know this life path is not for me. I feel like there‚Äôs a lot of societal pressure to value independence over family. I see myself finding more meaning in life through taking care of the people I hold dearest to me and wanting to make my house - a home. Creating a ambience of understanding, peace and love. 

I‚Äôm thinking of creating a group chat for us girls to converse about the issues we face in this sector. Let me know if you relate!"

Zigludo-sama,INFJ,"First post in this community, I've just been having a rough time with this and wanted to see if any of you other feels-wizards could relate to this.

Like many of you, I'm someone who has a few super close friends, a nice dynamic with my coworkers, and not much besides that. I'm not enough of a social creature to go out and make a bunch of acquaintances and I don't like big groups. Sometimes, this works out just fine, and I don't feel like I'm lacking in social experiences. This last year and a half has been a doozy though, as I'm sure it has been for all of you. I graduated college in 2020 and felt like I hardly had anything to ground me besides my relationship I had at the time. This relationship became pretty codependent during the pandemic, and strained to the point of breaking in March this year. 

I had been leaning on this relationship too much for social fulfillment and for meeting my emotional needs, and the last four months have been... really tough. My close friends are all really busy with work or have moved away, and as such I've ended up feeling completely alone a lot of the time. For anyone outside the 3-4 people I'm close friends with, I have to be the one to reach out, every single time, and oftentimes people just don't respond. A few years ago I never would have imagined it, but now the complete lack of texts/DMs/etc. is really starting to eat at me. 

I am grateful for the love and support of my few close friends and my family, of course. I am lucky to have these people in my life. But I cannot deny a feeling of frustration at feeling so socially barren when I would do so much to accommodate others and their needs. Does this feel relatable to any of you?"
Zigludo-sama,INFJ,"Hey, sorry if this is kind of a useless post. But I've just been keeping an eye on the stackham horror web page, and it seems as though every cycle besides Carcosa (and Innsmouth I guess, since it came out recently) is getting steady reprints. Any idea why this might be the case? It's just frustrating because I've collected half the cycle and just want to finally get around to playing it. :/"

Zigludo-sama,INFJ,"I've been semi-successfully trying to get a friend to play the game with me, and after going through NOTZ we've started playing through Dunwich as a damage-dealing Akachi (him) and a clue-gathering Wendy (me). We finally had the opportunity to play The House Always Wins (2nd scenario for us), and I was looking forward to showing him how thematic and creative the game can be through this scenario. Things start off okay enough, but our luck starts to sour right as we reach the second agenda. On top of the Pit Boss and Conglomeration of Spheres bearing down on us, my friend has the misfortune of drawing a Servant of the Lurker right after advancing the Agenda. We then proceed to slowly shrivel away the pile of enemies ganging up on us while I put in some work evading enemies and giving us time to kill them all. Having taken a few horror hits already, I then proceed to draw an autofail on Rotting remains, use my ability to redraw, and then draw a -4, putting me dangerously low on sanity. The turn we are finally able to clear out all the enemies, I draw Abandoned and Alone and am defeated by sanity damage. My buddy wisely decides to resign and live to fight another day. We never even made it into the Darkened Hall...

Thankfully, our terrible luck hasn't turned him off of continuing the campaign, so fingers crossed that things go better the rest of the way!

What are some similar moments you've had where the game just won't give you a break?"
Zigludo-sama,INFJ,"Hey, I've played through Dunwich and am waiting on pre-ordered Carcosa mythos packs from Boardlandia to complete that cycle. My LGS has multiple other cycles fully in stock, and I was considering picking up a full cycle while it was still available there (I'm fully addicted to this game, please send help). Dream Eaters doesn't sound like a good idea until I have a larger collection, so I was torn between TFA and TCU. Both seem interesting for different reasons, though TCU looks to have more interesting investigators and player cards. I would feel a little weird going ""out of order,"" though. What would your recommendation be?"
Zigludo-sama,INFJ,"Like a lot of you, I was kinda baffled and really disappointed by the last chapter. After reading the official release and thinking about it some more, I definitely feel like there's some stuff that is decent there and some stuff that almost works, but not quite. I think a few small things would go a long way - please comment any ideas that came to mind for you.

&#x200B;

1. The 'Lelouch' plan was a backup, or something: Have Eren still be really overwhelmed by past and future memories and feeling a lack of control over his path, but have him assert that his main plan was to kill 100% of people to ensure his friends' safety, with the possibility of his friends killing him and being seen as heroes as a contingency plan if he fails. It's a win-win for him. This would feel a little more consistent with his character IMO and wouldn't require any big rewriting.
2. Show, through dialogue-less panels and mind's-eye imagery, Ymir letting go of her attachment to King Fritz and releasing the power of the Titans: This was actually one of the biggest disappointments of the chapter for me. After all the mystery surrounding Ymir and the widely-held prediction that she'll end the power of the titans, this incredibly important moment happens offscreen and is lazily explained through Eren's dialogue to Armin. Really feels like something we should have seen rather than something that was just told directly to us.
3. Make Eren's whining about Mikasa less pathetic: I get that it's meant to bring him down to earth a little, but come on.
4. ""Thank you for becoming a mass murderer for our sake"": Have Armin & the alliance understand and feel sympathy for Eren, sure, but it feels weird and out of character for them to be singing his praises after he just killed 80% of the earth's population. It's just so weird and tone-deaf.
5. Give us something, anything from Historia's POV. I'm not a shipper or anything, but the way she was handled post-timeskip was like a mystery box that was never opened. I don't really know how Yams could have salvaged this one besides devoting half the chapter to her.
6. Consequences for everyone turning into titans: the best part of 138 was completely invalidated by the final chapter. Even if people turn back, maybe one of the shifters was eaten or something before it happened. Shit, I dunno. Just give me SOMETHING Isayama!
7. Nix the humor: All the humor in the chapter fell really flat for me, especially Reiner sniffing the letter. Writing this sort of banter is not really Isayama's strong suit. I think the gang probably should have just been somber and contemplative (something he's a lot better at writing) and it would have been a lot better.

  
Anyways, that's all I've got. Let me know if you have any non-shitpost thoughts and ideas."

There are a lot of posts here from a lover/wannabe lover  trying to understand ESTPs. Kind of a pattern emerging!üòÇ


Do you think that this statement is accurate for ESTPs (in a conceptual sense)? 

ESTP have trouble seeing the correlation (Ne demon) between their actions (Se) and predicting how they may potentially hurt others/others may react (Fe) in the future (Ni). 


This is just an insight and I‚Äôm not sure if it aligns accurately with functions. I‚Äôm not sure how Ti fits in there... I think it‚Äôs gonna be something about the prediction cos that‚Äôs data analysis. So you could be thinking of how people usually act in the same situation and making another link between that. 

I‚Äôd be interested to hear your thoughts/criticisms if you think I‚Äôm completely wrong or a scorned butt hurt lover etc üòÇ"
Stardust_Lovers929,INFJ,"I need help with an ESTP friend and looking for some tips on how INFJ & ESTPs can communicate better? Do you have any advice?

I am a INFJ 9w1 & he is ESTP 8w7 (could be an 7w8). Basically he pushes my boundaries and is annoying to the point where I get angry and unleash the INFJ horrible insults which hurt him or I just go MIA to avoid the conflict because it‚Äôs stressing me out (which again hurt him and he misinterprets my reasons for wanting space)üòü 

I feel I should also say that despite our rare fights he is that one person who was there for me when no one else was and vice versa. We always have each other‚Äôs back. Not bashing on the  ESTPs here just want to solve this and overcome repeating the same pattern."

Stardust_Lovers929,INFJ,"Having lower Fi (introverted feeling) does that mean that we are detached from our feelings? 

I know that it‚Äôs a stereotype of other Ti users, does it also apply to us? 

Should we be trying to increase our Fi and our awareness of our own feelings? 

I had an ISTJ & INFP asking me about my feelings for someone and I feel confused. I think I try to analyse my own feelings using Ti and then I start freaking out because I just don‚Äôt know. I can‚Äôt give them the answers they want or describe my emotions like they can."
