an-average-white-guy,INTJ,"ADHD would also be a factor, but learning a whole bunch of shit (equivalent to 3 new roles) at once is a struggle and making me feel useless, especially when I have to also deliver results while learning everything.

I know it's just a symptom of the overall problem and confidence will fix it, but how do you guys go with learning a lot of technical things at once with no practice buffer? Any time management techniques you've found useful?"

an-average-white-guy,INTJ,"I'm still new, but I managed to completely bungle my first satellite orbit attempt around Mun. I built everything fine, got there without any issues, deployed the protective cone - only to realise that I put the solar panels on the lower part of the rocket that just got ejected into space. It took me a few seconds to register while I watched my satellite power down and float into the vacuum of space lol.

What are some of your biggest failures or funny moments in Kerbal?"
an-average-white-guy,INTJ,"If so, do you have any tips for making a plane fly fucking straight enough to take off? Rockets are easy, but planes seem to be doing my head in"
an-average-white-guy,INTJ,"I'm new to Kerbal and can't get initiate a manoeuvre, the rocket just ignores it. 

I start burning 20 - 10 seconds before it hits while aiming at the blue manoeuvre node and have the required delta v & fuel required for the manoeuvre, yet every time my rocket passes the orange line and does it's own trajectory. 

I've googled and watched heaps of vids but everyone seems to follow the orange line. I feel like I'm missing something very obvious"
an-average-white-guy,INTJ,"I know it's been said for so long, but with now China saying they're 30 years away and building an artificial sun, my fingers are crossed. 
Do you reckon it will actually happen this time?"
an-average-white-guy,INTJ,"(A subjective question) For me I'd say ESFJ, or any type with S, F and J."

an-average-white-guy,INTJ,"I used to be talkative and interact with the people I worked with, but in the last few years I can't be fucked. They either can't hold a conversation or want to small talk me to death. If they start talking to me, I just walk off and pretend that I couldn't hear them. Is anyone else here like that? I would ask on that other INTJ sub but I'm pretty sure all the non-INTJs would reply"
an-average-white-guy,INTJ,"In this hypothetical world, travelling at the speed of light is possible and time dilation does not exist. You have a starship, unlimited fuel and a space suit that allows you to stay alive on any planet. Which planet in our universe would you most be curious to see for yourself?"
