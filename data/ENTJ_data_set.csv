Johann__Liebert,ENTJ,"I am 18 years from germany and studying psychology at a university. 

Briggs herself didn’t agree with jungs previous views (1921) so she/they improved it in a better way and did actually a „biological/personality personality construct“ (idk why they call them like that) which describes traits and much more (making it actually useful). 
Jungs or other people later tried to make their construct fit in but Briggs didn’t agree again, because of the way it’s ranked. 

1. Ranking System (in general) of dominant, auxiliary etc. All of our functions (I mean S,N,F,T and if you really consider them as the only cognitive functions because we have much more constructs about cognition itself) are nearly evenly balanced. Also Fe + Fi = F so no need to splitting it up. Inwards and outwards doesn’t matter we do both. 

1.5. Distances and scales between functions in the ranking... why does nobody talked yet about them??? It was actually a criticism point indirectly by Myers herself.

2. Ranking Systems (the opposites of each functions). Why do people even believe in that nowadays? If you’re dominant function is Te somewhere down there is a Fi. We have the dual process thinking and the elaboration likelihood model to explain anything of our thinking. Fast descisions contain much emotions... we also have that in the „Somatic marker hypothesis“. Nearly anything has an emotional value (even egoism), but that does not mean you can’t make fast logical descisions... it’s about chances and experiences. Longer thinking processes have much more rationality. That’s a total hard stance in psychology. No doubt about that. If you have no motivation to process anything above doesn’t makes sense (look for Elaboration likelihood model or need for cognition). So we can use Te and Fi at the same time and whatever. Inferior Fi doesn’t mean you have no emotions and all that stuff. „Rational outside and irrational inside“ doesn’t make sense at all lol. Observation and intuition are also different tools you can use at the same time most of it happens in the unconsciousness and carefully selected by our attentiveness processes or Baddeley's model of working memory. 

2.5. Role of consciousness and unconsciousness. He or the people ignored anything of it so the construct can describe anything it wants with no reliability. (I have Freud flashbacks)

3. Ranking System (of energy). Yes, this construct is old and in today’s psychology introversion is just the opposite of extroversion (one of the big 5 always was/will be). It’s due to inaccuracy to build up intro and extroversion (because we always can have both traits) so psychologists decided to do an interesting dimension of describing extroversion in their full matured description (traits also introverted people have) and put a new dimension (neuroticism, yeah PEN used it also before I know) with general fears and vulnerability. Inferior Fi doesn’t mean you have no emotions and all that stuff. „Rational outside and irrational inside“ doesn’t make sense at all lol. I’ve also heard people talking that observers would be better at checking informations of fake ids in clubs if it’s introverted or ISFJs surpress their Si and thats why they get different results. Guys... you’ve really took it to another level. If you have Si you also should have Se otherwise we won’t work (if you restrict it to the concept as the only cognitive construct). 

4. Cognitive personality constructs aren`t really meant to describe personality traits. They describe internal processes of brain functions. Cognitive functions can`t describe and predict behavior/descisions. Psychology would never accept that (and didn`t lol). There is no consistent system, only interpretations far from reality. You can`t describe anything with it. You just believe in nothing.

5. Tests are extremely innacccurate and don`t possess any meassuring system. The construct itself doesn`t possess one too lol. No objectivity, no reliability and no vailidity. The most important criteria in psychology to operationalize. 

6. Psychologists laugh about this construct. Yes, thats true, but I don`t want to talk about it lol. To describe a persons brain functions you need a construct and several psychologists to do so.  This construct isn`t represantative and every psychologist would agree with that.


At the end there is no good study against cognitive functions by jung. Nothing in favor for this construct. In science you proove hypothesis with the falsification method. There is nothing, but this idea and many many arguments against it.  If this community wouldn’t believe in this construct it would’ve get forgotten. It’s also really respectful to call this a construct, because it isn’t... a construct is (officially proven and) there to help describe behavior and all that stuff. 

Psychologists give a fuck about it, because all our knowledge has improved very much.

Hope you read my message :) I have a very difficult time staying consistent at anything for more than 4 weeks. I grind at it, reward myself and try to do it despite my lack of discipline. Think exercise, language learning or what not. 

The problem I face is that I do what I can but whenever my mind says ''break'' for usually more than one day in a row, a door of comfort enters my room and the whole existence of my disciplined goal becomes history quickly. 

I'm hoping to stick to healthy habits for hopefully... ever? I am cognizant about the health benefits that it provides so I have this mentality that I ''should'' do them. What is a healthy approach of havings habits stick consistently?"

I was worried that I had autism for a long period of time. People would bully me and call me autistic on numerous occasions. Tests would suggest the same, but ''luckily'' no doctor ever diagnosed me and I do not believe to have any form of autism."
edgy_eggplant,INFJ,"Hello everyone, INFJ here.

My new roommate is an INTP and I had great difficulties typing her and it took me a couple of weeks to do that. My first impression was that she was an ESFP because I saw Se in her and thought she was a feeler. But then when she moved in, I observed her more closely, we started to talk a lot, I asked her a lot of questions, and I could clearly identify Ti and Fe in her, and since Se was still there, I thought she could be an ESTP or ISTP but it just didn't click. I get along well with ISTPs but they wear me out pretty fast, and with her I could talk for hours and not get tired at all. The ISTP didn't click with her either when she read about it. And Se wasn't her dominant function either. So I thought that she must be something else. Her Fe was undeniable, and at some point I thought that maybe she's an ENFJ, since ENFJs have Ti and Se too, but that didn't feel right either because her Ti was definitely not inferior and also because I don't get along with ENFJs lol. I was very confused. At some point I was like ok fuck it, let's take this functions test and see what it will show, and as she was answering the questions it dawned on me at last that she's an INTP but I swear to God I have never seen an INTP like that. Now it all makes sense, and it clicked with her right away, and I realised why we get along so well. We connect on so many levels, and I can be my dumb weird self around her which is awesome.

But the question with Se remains. The functions test also showed that her Se is quite high. She plays drums (although she did mention that it didn't come naturally to her like to most other people in her music school and university). She's pretty active in the real world (compared to most INTPs), doesn't spend too much time on her phone and on the Internet in general. She likes to go out and party with people and has a lot of friends (I know it's a stereotype that INTPs are reclusive but still). She did many kinds of sports as a kid and was almost xSTP like in her behaviour (stealing road signs for fun etc). I know that one shouldn't type people based on behaviour, and I try to avoid that but I still pay too much attention to behaviour when typing people. When it comes to the theory, I've read somewhere that the 7th function can trick other people and look as if it's well developed. I've seen that in INFJs with their Te for sure. But then INxPs are supposed to be Se blind? That doesn't sound like they're good at it. Could you please explain to me how this works with the 7th function and with INTPs' Se in particular?

Edit: The test said she's an ENTP but she's definitely not. [Here are her test results](https://ibb.co/vh38PBC). She's all into typology now too lol and wants to talk to me about it all the time.

Thank you very much."
edgy_eggplant,INFJ,"Hello, ENTJs, I have a question for you.

I've noticed that ExTJs tend to value loyalty in relationships a lot, and I was wondering if this has something to do with your cognitive functions stack. In my observation when ExTJs get emotional they tend to feel as if everyone in their lives betrayed them or is against them and as if they can only count on themselves and everyone else is basically an asshole they can't trust. Unhealthy ExTJs that I've known tend to have this way of seeing others as their general mindset. Do these things have to do with inferior Fi?

Thank you."
edgy_eggplant,INFJ,Act fake around each other for several hours then go home.
edgy_eggplant,INFJ,"Hello everyone,

I have problems understanding and identifying tertiary function in people, and I hope that you guys could help me understand it better. I can easily identify tertiary Si in INxPs as it's pretty out there. INxPs tend to be nostalgic and cherish objects that are meaningful to them (which in extreme cases can lead to hoarding). I'm sure there's more to tertiary Si (please, tell me) but at least I can actually see it with my own eyes, which is very helpful. However, when it comes to others, I really don't quite understand how tertiary Se, Ni, Ne, Fi, Fe, Te and sometimes even Ti look like.

I would be really thankful if you could explain to me what the purpose of tertiary function is. I know it's not very well developed and it's the function that keeps us curious (is that right?) but it somehow doesn't help me at all. I can read about it for hours and still not understand it. I would like to know what it is I should pay attention to in people when trying to identify tertiary function.

Thank you."
edgy_eggplant,INFJ,"Hello, everyone 😊

Basically this very specific question in the title. How do you see yourselves and what difficulties do you face in life if you don't mind sharing?

Also, if you're a different type but know a 4 sx/so INFJ I would be happy to hear how you see them and what your relationship with them is like.

It's for my personal research but I think that other people might find this interesting as well.

Thank you very much and have a nice day or night or whatever 🙃💕🌿"
edgy_eggplant,INFJ,There's no such thing as Introverted Intuition. I've been carefully studying and observing my mind since day one of my miserable existence on this wretched planet and today I finally realised that my dominant cognitive function is Nr - Introverted Retardation. I use my Introverted Retardation to come to realisations like this. I'm gonna go kill myself now. Have a nice day.
edgy_eggplant,INFJ,"Hello, 4w5 here,

I would really appreciate your help with determining my instinctual variant/stacking because I am very confused. I've read a number of descriptions on different websites and I've also watched all the videos on Type Four by Dr. Tom Lahue. After watching his videos I was certain I was a social type as I tend to be very open and expressive with my emotions, especially the ""negative"" ones. I draw and sing and play sad songs on my guitar and I can't not do that. I am simply unable to keep all of this to myself, it just pours out of me constantly. I have to present it somehow and attract attention to myself. There's even this weird thing that I noticed a very long time ago about myself that if I make my social accounts like Twitter or Instagram private then I'm not motivated to post anything anymore. Like what is the point in posting if random people can't visit my account anyway? I want to attract people for a number of reasons, the main ones would be that I want people to know that I exist and I want to impress and/or confuse them as well as find and connect with people like me. Lately I've been obsessed with finding a person who is very similar to me.

All in all, I kind of want people to know how I'm doing. And it's not that I expect some kind of reaction in return. Most reactions that I get are very disappointing to me and not particularly because people don't get me, which they often don't, but because their reactions kinda kill my vibes? It's weird. I am very happy to get reactions from people who get it though. They do not kill my vides :D I also tend to express my moods in the way I dress. Basically it's all about the mood and expressing my mood in any possible way.

So, I was sure that I'm a social type but then I read the description in ""The Wisdom of the Enneagram"" and now I don't know what type I am lol because I strongly identify with the social and sexual variants and also to some extent with the self-preservation variant. I will describe it all in detail.

**SP:** I can relate to the description of the sp type as the most introverted Four although maybe I don't understand it correctly. I basically isolate myself from any real human interaction because I'm not interested in it very much anymore but I tend to be overly active online. I'm basically all over the place on the Internet and I post A LOT. If I understand it correctly sp Fours don't even do that? I am also very obsessive about my physical surroundings because in order to be able to chill which is what I like to do most I need everything to be soothing to my senses. But I generally connect that to my high sensitivity. Lighting, temperature, sounds - everything needs to make me feel comfortable. I can also sometimes buy stuff that's not essential because I want it right now even though I can't really afford it. I don't crave rich foods or luxury though. But just like an sp type I can have poor eating habits and health routines and can basically lead a self-indulgent lifestyle. I have never ever been irresponsible if other people are involved though. I am never late, I never decide not to show up at my job and I always manage to pay my bills. I basically can't bear the thought of being an inconvenience to others, and I don't like it when other people act irresponsibly and especially when they create inconveniences for myself. I don't care about how they live their lives but if they create problems for me I have a huge problem with that. Also, when I become too self-indulgent it starts to bother me at some point and I take it under control more or less. The idea of losing control over my life completely is scary to me.

**SO:** Basically the whole section about the SO type from the book is about me. Seeing myself as totally unique? Yes. But I kind of want to find someone who is like me. But that way I guess I would accept their uniqueness as part of my own? Why am I like this hahahah lol anyway ""They experience their uniqueness as both the gift they bring to others and the burden they must bear"" - yes. ""They tend to be the most socially active"" - not anymore but people used to think and can still think that I'm an extrovert for sure. And I also used to go out of my way to connect with others. I also went to several universities and moved to a different country. I've had several jobs where I came in contact with all kinds of different people all the time. I've been rather active socially, like I've known a lot of people, and I do mean a lot. Which is why I'm sometimes surprised that some people live their lives without ever meeting an INFJ or an INTJ or an ENTP in real life because I've met at least 10 of each of them all of different nationalities/genders/ages/religions etc. Maybe people don't know they are dealing with these types though, I don't know. I have them all in my head. I basically do not forget a single person I've ever interacted with even if it's been a stranger on the Internet and I analyze the shit out of everyone and I remember every dumb little detail they told me about themselves and even about their partners whom I'd never met. Very often people tend to be surprised and flattered that I remember all this stuff about them. All this information will sometimes randomly pop up in my memory when I analyze someone new. To me it looks like a huge database of people in my mind accessible to me 24/7. When I meet someone new, whether I want it or not, I will compare them to all the people that I have in my mind. Like who do they remind me of and why and what are the differences. I'd say that I used to be socially active mainly out of incredible curiosity about people's minds. The wish to connect came after that. Now that I feel I have enough information about people in my mind I can use it without having the need to directly interact with them, so I just tend to be all by myself because real human interaction is emotionally exhausting to me. Also, YouTube, reddit and basically any other social media allows me to analyze people without leaving my house. I will even analyze people's writing style. Sometimes it's very obvious to me that someone's writing style doesn't match the type they claim to be. I'm writing all this and thinking what the fuck is wrong with me lol :D Sorry if that freaks you out. And if you are like me and want to talk about it, please, dm me.

I totally see myself as the intellectual elite. I speak several languages and consider myself very intelligent. I don't care about having a career though, at least not in the classical sense, whatever that means. I would like to have a stable income of course because being constantly broke isn't so much fun. But I guess I'm lazy and also I don't want to do anything that would emotionally drain me which is basically anything that involves direct contact with other human beings. Working as a translator from home sounds very appealing to me. I think I'd be interested in translating books on psychology into Russian.

""Isolation along with fantasies of achievement may cause unhealthy Social Fours to waste their lives"" - this scares the shit out of me. I don't want to waste my life. I want to matter and make a difference but I feel like I'm still waiting for my wake-up call. Maybe it's because I'm still getting my second degree and I've actually been a very decent student. I know I can achieve a lot, I'm just super fucking lazy. Or maybe I'm still scared that I'm not good enough, I don't know. Fear has always been my greatest motivator but I need to feel really pressured to eventually start doing something productive and make a radical change. Again, if other people are involved I'm very responsible so it would actually help me to have a couple of responsibilities and deadlines.

**SX:** This is where it gets really confusing to me. ""Sexual Fours most exemplify the romanticism, intensity, and longing for a rescuer that characterize this type"" - this is absolutely me. I've been in several reltionships, and in each and every one of them I was looking for my ""savior"". For the most part I wanted him to save me from the burdens of reality and of my own mind. ""... Unlike the other two variants, they are unlikely to let their romantic fantasies remain fantasies for long"" - I used to jump from one BIG LOVE to another BIG LOVE which confused people a lot. I don't do that anymore and I'm single now but I still have this weird fantasy of meeting an older self-aware 4w5 INFJ male to experience this amazing connection or how I like to call it ""the ultimate merge"" lol. And even though I know that it might all go to shit I cannot stop fantsizing about it and longing for it.

""They can be sweetly vulnerble and impressionable, but also aggressive and dynamic, especially in their self-expression"" - this is also me. Like I said before, my moods are all over the place and I can start singing a song and by the end of it I will be crying as if everyone I've ever loved are ded gon. Many people see me as sweet, naive and childish until I show them my other sides. I can switch from childish to sensual and sexual in a matter of seconds and I think this whole mix scares and confuses people.

""Often turbulent and stormy, their emotional lives revolve around the person they are attracted to"" - this is absolutely me. My emotional states depend on how the person I'm in love with/my partner is treating me. ""Intense feelings of admiration, longing, and hatred for the object of desire can all coexist"" / ""Jealous and possessive ... they want to be the only person that matters in the other's life"" / ""Relationship problems arise because Sexual Fours often become romantically involved with people who have qualities that Fours admire or want in themselves, but then end up envying and resenting the loved one for having these very qualities"" - yes and it's all very exhausting and that is why I choose to be single these days. I am much more stable when I'm alone. But I still fantasize about having a relationship. ""At the same time, Sexual Fours are often attracted to people who are, for one reason or another, unavailable"" - like fantasizing about a person who might not exist? Yes.

If you've read the whole thing, thank you very much and I would really appreciate if you could help me figure out my instinctual variant. I would also like to hear from other Fours. How do you deal with all of this? Is there anything that has helped you to take some of these habits/traits etc. under control? Please, do not suggest therapy as that's implied, and you know that we tend to be avid therapy goers anyway :)

Thank you very much once again.

Edit: If you know the answer to this question, what determines what instinctual variant a person will have? Is it innate or do we develop it as we grow?"

Lightweaver0,INTP,"I just finished Riyria Revelations, and absolutely loved them. Feels like coming off a high now that I'm done with the final book.

Looking for similar books so, here's some things that I loved about Riyria.

&#x200B;

* **The endearing positive characters.** Now, I love Royce, but there's plenty of brooding characters like Royce in fantasy. There are also enough characters who would be considered good because they do the right thing technically. But it's really rare to see characters like Hadrian who genuinely cares and connects with everyone in such a warm and friendly way (it's not merely about the big picture good with him), and Myron, the sweetest and most insightful guy.

&#x200B;

* **The female characters.** Arista is personally one of my favourites. People seem to have mixed opinions about her, but I loved her journey and thinking. I also liked that she and Modina didn't have to be warriors in the literal sense to be strong female characters. Don't get me wrong, I love the Lenare Pickerings of fantasy, but some authors make it seem like that is the *only* way to be ""strong."" When really, there's different kinds of smart women, and it's obvious that in a patriarchal world like Arista's, you'll find all these other kinds of interesting women more often. So they should be written about too.

&#x200B;

* The strong bonds and friendship.

&#x200B;

* **Slow and subtle romance.** So romance is often a miss with me. I'm really not a fan of obsessive love, insta-love, triangles etc, or when it overtakes the main story. That being said, a subtle amount can definitely make a story much better if done well. I like it when it's taken slow, so you can see the genuine reasons why and how characters come to care for each other. The one in Riyria *definitely* grew on me.

&#x200B;

* **The satisfying end.** I read fantasy to escape and I like escaping to something that I can take away good things from. I really don't mind dark journeys, but at the end of the day I like some positive themes, something that ends on a good, hopeful note.   
Nothin' like a book that leaves you smiling, and Riyria left me with sooo many good feelings.

So yeah I'd really appreciate some recommendations based on this. Goodreads suggested a few but they all seem very Grimdark/mature. I'm looking for something that has Riyria-like levity.

(I've also read everything by Sanderson, and I know of the Chronicles.)"

Sin embargo, al intentar buscar información sobre la prevalencia de la depresión en Bogotá o en toda Colombia la última actualización del boletín del Ministerio de Salud fue el 2017; buscando en Google Académico, Academia y todo el cuento, no logré encontrar lo que necesitaba. ?¿Alguno sabe dónde buscar o tiene documentos vigentes del tema?

REShockwave,ENTJ,"To be perfectly honest, in my group of friends and with my INFP partner, I’m always known as the quiet, listening type that unless I got something interesting to say, I would always remain quiet, attentively listening to the other party. 

I stopped giving a fuck about this and just embraced that I would much enjoy learning, cooking up new ideas in my head, and based on that give the most proper feedback while being a listening conversationalist. 

Anyone else enjoy listening, than blabbing while being with friends/other people?"
REShockwave,ENTJ,"I finally got out of med school first semester finals today; but just a few minutes ago I started to feel tired, confused, angry, with an urge to scream my lungs off, despite already being on a well deserved month and a half break.

REShockwave,ENTJ,"Affectionate ENTJ here: just wanted to remind you all, that one of your own (my INFP partner) actually managed to make me (an ENTJ) cry and let all my repressed feelings spill. 

Lately I’ve been feeling pretty overwhelmed with university work even though I’m ad Portas of a well deserved month-and-a-half break. She just knew something was wrong with me, and actually ordered me to cry, so I did. 

How the hell are you guys so wholesome? How do you manage to make our (perhaps other ENTJs like me) hearts beat every time we talk to you? How do you make other types feel so loved, taken care of, nourished in some way, unafraid to actually FEEL? I ask myself everytime I see her/talk to her on the phone, grateful I’ve met a wonderful person like her; so strong yet fragile, an angel helping me fight my own demons even though she’s already fighting her own? 

Perhaps these questions will never be answered, and without further due and mush, just wanted to say, thank you for being there, you’re great, you’re the strongest types I’ve ever met, and take care. 

TL;DR: Congrats on making an ENTJ cry like a baby :v"

Corspin,ENTJ,"In my country I can vote for a party that does resembles neoliberalism very closely, they do very well in the elections and stands for all the good stuff like free trade, open borders, good monetary policy, not too much government spending, apply the necessary government control but keep it small. 

You guys from America seem quite stoked about the democratic party. However, from my perspective I can't help but think that socialists or people who pander to identity politics (eg. Sanders, AOC and more) have no place in neoliberalism and they definitely give me a slight distaste for the party as a whole.

You Americans on the other hand pride yourself on the democratic party being a ""big tent"". Surely I can see why that would attract more voters but in my opinion it muddles the real ideas and goals of neoliberalism are. Given that Republicans also don't like socialists, I don't expect to see them return to a political position if the democratic party would throw them out.

Why do you want to put up and negotiate with these people?"

If you want to add reasons or start a discussion about some given points then you can post them in the comments as usual.

&#x200B;

There are many positions in capitalism and socialism, however many have some grey area's that make the definitions not all that useful:

* Equality vs markets.

At first this seems decent because markets cause inequality but they are not mutually exclusive. Eg. Welfare states and the Nordic model both combine a free market with wealth redistribution.

* Public vs private ownership of production.

This one is mutually exclusive and therefore is the one I personally use. As good as it is, this one also has some contention when arguing about workplace democracy. This gives workers more autonomy over their work and therefore could be argued as public ownership. However this would require workers to have private ownership of shares in the company and earn income from them, which are both premises of property rights that is fundamental to capitalism.

* So here we are at property rights.

Private property rights are essential to capitalism because it justifies private ownership of production and allows free trade. I've added all points of private property rights at the bottom and I suspect that capitalists will agree with most of them. Socialists probably agree to some of these because of the argument that one has the right to own the product of their labor.

Private property rights include the right to own:

* Land;
* Money;
* Personal property;
   * Incl. consumer goods;
* Real estate;
* Raw materials for production;
* Royalties;
* Copyrights;
* Patents;
* Shares in companies.

The owner has the right to:

* Use the good;
* Earn income from the good;
* Transfer the good to others;
* Alter the good;
* Abandon the good;
* Destroy the good."

What is sexual attraction? I just spent half the day questioning my (demi)sexuality. I have sexual arousal and perhaps a desire for sex. But, I didn’t think I really understood sexual attraction (I’m not sure if I have any basis for it) until I had the stupid epiphany that people may be attracted to one another through sex. So, is that what sexual attraction is? Just being attracted to (i.e. wanting to be with) someone because of the sex you can have together? That definition feels both alien as well as something that seems like people would engage in, I don’t know."

Hi! I’m looking for a woman to chat/make friends with first (before any sort of romance). I normally wouldn’t look for an online relationship (surprise, surprise) but I thought I’d toss my hat in and see what happens. Hopefully you’re in California too!

I am a mixed race Filipino American in the middle of switching careers to graphic design. I will likely be getting my second degree in a year. I love cooking, linguistics, writing, art, and learning new things. I tend to like dreaming up/participating in communal projects and talking about science, space, and the future. I do hope to be a father one day.

Now for some bad stuff: I am currently partially disabled, having improved from being fully disabled a few years ago. Due to disability plus doing school, I’m not yet working enough hours in the week to support myself financially, so things are a bit of a mess on that end. But, my health is improving slowly over the years, and I do predict that things will be better after finishing school.

As for sexuality, I am heterosexual demisexual. I haven’t looked into romantic orientations so I don’t have a clue yet how to navigate that aspect. I am in the sex-indifferent/sex-positive grouping and hope to find someone of the same type.

Also, I don’t want to be awake right now! I’m being a bit of an insomniac, goodnight!"

I didn’t even notice that at all.” Normally I can immediately see when someone is attractive, but this time I had to become aware of it first. I guess what surprised me was that I was being more asexual (if this lack of awareness of physical attractiveness is accurately asexual) than I’ve previously recognized in myself. I feel that being out and about, I probably haven’t been giving people their due. Is this a trait of asexuality or does it go by a different moniker?"

Would it be good to make mixed race subreddits for the UK, or for sections of Australia or Europe for example? I would maybe limit sections to a country or an area within a day’s drive.

Also, feel free to share some other info you have on the area that you think I may like to know. For example, I've heard drug addiction is a big problem here. Is it meth, opioids, cocaine, fentanyl ... all of the above? How common an observance is it? What about crime in general - unusually high?

Thank you!"

westwoo,INFP,"There's this stereotypical representation of ENTJs as wealthy CEOs or ambitious millionaires, though obviously the vast majority of ENTJs can't be significantly wealthier than the average based on all data about incomes of MBTI types that we have.

But similarly stereotypical ENTJ goals and aspirations don't make sense for a person of about an average income and wealth. They would lead to feelings of unfulfillment if they were actually true, and ENTJs aren't really known for being more prone to depression or sadness than other types.

Meaning, there has to be much more to this, and perhaps a lot more other types and younger ENTJs can learn about what really drives you...."
nanomvrk9,ENTJ,"A lot of comments and posts on this sub come from not just gay men but bi men too, sometimes others. It's great that everyone can participate but it skews the posts and comments because people with different sexualities offer different perspectives.

Even if you indetify as gay/straight, if you have a ANY sexual attraction towards the same *and* the opposite sex you should be identifying at least as bi.

This might totally fail but I think it would be a great idea to (as a standard) start using the editable community flair to place our sexualities so that our comments and posts have some context of where we're coming from."
nanomvrk9,ENTJ,"I'm not saying people should be physically abused, mocked, or scarred by their peers or anyone else, but old school healthy social bullying keeps kids, teens, and adults aware that to fit into the social scheme they need to learn to adapt and communicate with others. 

Bullying still exists but now it's about emotional manipulation to get people to bend to your will through peer pressure that can ruin your life instead of just making you feel left out for a bit cause someone called you a loser or a freak. It seems that now we have people more than ever who are super sensitive and think their feelings should bend reality around them. 

It's immoral, self centered, self involved, and dangerous to not have ""healthy"" bullying as a natural occurrence meant to shape socialization in a healthy way."
nanomvrk9,ENTJ,"I've always strongly related and sometimes have even been downright embarrassed by the accurate description of type 8s. I've taken tests, seen videos, read theories, read descriptions in books, tied some concepts to MBTI and me being an ENTJ, but seeing the main enneagram sub's comments and memes of 8s made me question why I didn't relate to a lot of it and why the content I did relate to was so general it could apply to almost anyone.

This sub is completely different though. I guess it takes an 8 to understand an 8."
nanomvrk9,ENTJ,"I'm over 20 so there was a period in my life where if you heard the word queer shouted, you should prepare for physical violence.

nanomvrk9,ENTJ,People keep using the words nazi and bigot as a knee jerk reaction to anyone who isn't 100% on board with everything liberal and it's taken away from the meaning. A decade ago the word nazi was a head turner that invoked so much seriousness and actual discomfort and now you see it so much that it really has little to no impact.
nanomvrk9,ENTJ,"Like many in the western world I grew up in a traditional Christian family. Coming to terms with being gay and opening myself up to others especially my family was a whirlwind of a mess. One of the things that really got me through it all was the idea that even though I'm gay I could still have a ""normal"" life.

I've definitely changed since, in that a ""normal"" life isn't something that calls to me. I'm not religious, not limited by obtuse gender roles, completely fine with being gay, have the self-preservation instinct to be my own person, and I've been realizing I don't even want a child. It seems though that this is going to be very limiting in terms of dating options since most of my past romantic interests have had the intention to one day have children.

nanomvrk9,ENTJ,"After the rapture came, some people were happy because their beliefs were confirmed, others disappointed for not knowing the whole story. Millions of people disappeared into what we call the void, but only the ones who refused to think larger than themselves. 

Time and space don't work the same on earth anymore. Everyone that has ever existed is here, somehow space never runs out, no one feels hunger anymore, no one can die anymore. It's strange to say, but the world is in a really good place. Science has gotten to the point where eating a single fruit can grant access knowledge to the structure of the universe.

For some reason Lucifer took a liking to me and I spend most of my time in his library and lab. I've been alive for millions of years now, not that that means anything, and honestly I just want to die. I've experienced everything and I'm going insane, it's time. I found a loophole to permit death, I've been working on it for the past couple hundred years. It's ready. 

I'm passing through the portal, once I'm on the other side I should be able to age and die.


 I wake up in a field, with a girl starring at me.
 

""Hi I'm awfully hungry"" she said politely. I can't even remember hunger anymore. Glad it worked. I can finally die.

""I thought this place would be empty, what's you're name?"" I ask grabbing an apple from my backpack to give her.

""Eve."""

Spongky,ENTJ,"\- i was just practicing minutes ago before writing - sometimes i doubt that will i be able to play those pieces? (*i started from zero at 24, been 2 years - just finished grade 5 abrsm*) because it's harder than it looks.. from an outsider, people may think it's only about pressing the right keys with fast hands, but it's really not - playing piano has many many nuances to sound right which can take a decade

\- this thought affects me because i didn't start at 4-5 & went to conservatory, so my frontal lobe & cortex aren't efficient for learning curve as much as a kid (i have a good teacher though, ex soloist of philharmonic of where i live)

\- you may say that i might just want some encouragement - no, even some say '***yes, sorry, it's impossible, you're too late, accept the reality***', i'd still not quit - all of this is just for to know whether am i hoping for a possible thing? (i secretly believe i can, if i'm serious to it enough and give them 10-15 years, but after all, i might be wrong - so i ask for how reality is (my practice time is max for 1.5-2 hours per day)) - if not, i'd lower my expectation and go for more pop style (i love them too), less technical requirement 

\- level of those pieces i mention about are like: apassionata, chop prelude 28 24 - i even hope for prokofiev 2 1st cadenza too 

\- please don't over encourage me, how reality is like from what yall've seen

Spongky,ENTJ,"\- reddit is global, it's somehow understandable, but in MBTI community where i live, with 40K members (facebook group), i rarely find them.. ***50% of discussion & post is INFP/INFJ/INTP - next 25% is ENFJ/ENFP/INTJ - the rest are those introverted sensors and assorted*** (excepts ESXX, mostly, i can't find em at all (but it makes sense, since extroverted sensor rarely give a shit about kinda this thing))

\- ***but where is ENTJ?*** i scroll down about 15-20 post to find one about ENTJ (or not at all), even a comment (for latter it's perhaps 100:1).. i'm not narcissistic - i don't buy all to that famous population distribution (since it's out of nowhere, where's reference?) - being rare doesn't mean superior (because it'd be inferior too, think of those exotic disease)

\- are they busying get the shit done? i don't think so, because i'm ENTJ, i do share some of yall essence, also according to many posts, they are really not what an outsider generally perceived, they don't stay productive 1000% all the time, yes they are hardworking but 'you are my bitch' said procrastination to ENTJ too, they have their pace, they are not a non-stop-killing-it-machine (anyway, i might be a defected ENTJ)

\- this sub is alive & has several new posts everyday, it shows that we do interest in 'categorisation' and finding patterns/system of things (see ESXX sub, it's dead, some type not even have their sub)

\- so, well, idk, since there're SO MUCH INFJ, maybe those are really rare is ENTJ? (again, i don't buy that population distribution, but in my irl, i've met only 1 (i never meet INTJ too))"

Super-Ad9248,ENTJ,"The problem: I still get triggers about my past experiences that I still freeze when someone or something reminds me of my childhood.

What I've tried: I can now able to put boundaries on people because I have developed my skill of communication. It works in some way, but it still makes me uncomfortable because I self-preserve.

Personal Context and Conclusion:
I just talked to a man who admits drinking alcohol and I automatically related him to the alcoholic grandfather I had growing up. In some way I felt powerless during the conversation because he did act in a similar way as my late granddad. 

Weirdly enough when my alcoholic grandfather passed, I reflected on how his life would have been and understood how he got to the point of being an alcoholic but to see someone like that triggered that helpless state that I had growing up.

I want to know how to get past this once and for all."

Super-Ad9248,ENTJ,"So, earlier today I was just doing my daily routine thing and I remember the criticisms I got as a child. I got told that I usually start things up to happen which was said in a way that my elders didn't agree upon, because for them it looked like I was starting chaos or messing it up but in my mind I was just so curious that I started trying to do it. The things was I was able to persuade the other kids in the neighborhood to explore together with me but because I was a child I was silly as I was. 

Metaphorically speaking, it's like dipping my pinky toe in a floor of lava just to see what happens. Because of my low Fi back then, I didn't talk back because I already feel negative. But what I was doing is just part of my personality trait as an ENTJ that got repressed over my teen years to early 20s because it was said in a way that was negative yet surprisingly, my elder were a bit accurate about it.

Now that I see things clearer by the day, I guess I really never hid my true trait, it was just compromised so much that I had to repress it and now that I am in no obligation to repress it I am learning about how my traits played a role in my life so far.

How about you guys, did you have any similar experience?"

What's your opinion on 50 shades of gray? The main character is suppose to be ENTJ. But he falls in love with casual, boring ISFJ. (Yea keep dreaming ladies, this is real life)

When I was a teenager I used to date ISFJ, she got wet about this movie just like every other girl. (At that time I had no idea about MBTI, I didn't see that movie, I didn't know I am the same personality as main character). But she was complaining how dominating I am, how I put too much pressure on her etc.

Please somebody explain this to me. Are the people really so naive to think, that somebody charismatic, confident, intelligent etc. falls in love with casual and boring? And if it won't happen, they will find somebody with oedipus complex and dress him like a man. (It's so fake, naive, and disgusting).
