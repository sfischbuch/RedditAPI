Hiyamygenderisweird,ISFJ,"I’m an echoist. I reflect what people give to me. It’s a subconscious control. If someone is loud, I will be loud as well. If someone is quiet, I will be as quiet as they’d like. I used to think this was just empathy and I was really empathetic. I mean I am but maybe it kind of is bc I only want people to be comfortable around me and like me. Essentially I have achieved this. It’s nice that people open up to me and trust me. I truly am grateful for it. But I have an off and on switch that I wish I could balance in the middle. When someone for example such as my parents say I’m doing something wrong I’ll go 100% in the opposite direction to compensate then they’re surprised at how well I adapted and perhaps they want me to go back to how I was just a little less of it. I feel frustrated by this because I essentially don’t want to be “wrong”. I adapt very quickly but it’s hard for me to “re-adapt”. I sort of have a “choose one” view. It’s probably linked to self-esteem and my past as a child, but how do I stop trying to accommodate for *everyone*? I’m an extrovert but I’m so tired of pushing myself out there that I wish I was an introvert. I’ve tried to be a bit quieter normally around family and friends but then they look at me with concern and I go right back to my natural personality to not disappoint them and have them believe I’m unhappy. At times I want to be quiet alone with my thoughts but I keep talking and talking until my throat is run dry then regret everything. It’s exhausting and I really wish I could just “pick one” and be done. This has even happened with my facial expressions. I have a naturally open and friendly expression and I correct my face to be how it needs to look for each person I talk to regularly. My friend told me at times I can have a resting bitch face and at times I don’t that it depends on my mood. So then in public I let my face fall then I see people looking uncomfortable and I go back to looking friendly. Now I change my expression so many times a day just alone or in public because I’m trying to find that balance where I look acceptable but I’m relaxed. I think I’m too self-aware or something like that. I’m just tired of changing and want stability in this matter. How do I achieve balance within myself? I’m a minor so still developing."

idkabettername,ENTP,"I do not know where to start. You are intelligent logically socially and creativity. Are able to focus on one vision to change the world which is admirable. As well as your care for the current and future generations. You are more empathetic then I will ever be and are very friendly and charming. You are willing to help anybody not matter what and your NiTi intellgence combined with your Fe charm is inspirarional. You are also very cute and the exact person I'd want to cuddle and I generally do not like physical contact. You keep me focused organised when I forgot those thing and unlike most J types actually motivate me to continue like that. You are generally very well balanced and have a good sense of humour. Your deeper and more introspective than I will ever be. You laugh at all the unfunny things I say and beleive anything I say is possible (even if it is not) you have a good sense of humour and I always want to learn more about your super fascinating brains. It sometimes feels like you are 1000 years ahead of us. You never show it all are the start so exploring your brain is like exploring a woods just more fascinating.

Can someone explain why this happens and how to break out from it. So every few months I have an absolute downhill spiral on all areas of my life and I feel absolutely horrible and the consequences of it is I’m stressed all the time and go on shutdown mode where I want to avoid everything. And then eventually I either gather my shit and start improving my life again or I keep avoiding the problem til it’s gone on it’s own. Repeato, happens 1-3 times a year."

And then eventually I either gather my shit and start improving my life again or I keep avoiding the problem til it’s gone on it’s own. 

I notice this trend cause during the beginning of the school year I do great and fantastic but then 2nd part of semester, I spiral down so hard. And it’s getting me into trouble with the school and getting my parents involved which just stresses me out more and want to shut down rather than reach out for help. Also the fact I go to a prestigious highschool with a early college program so it’s known to be super hard already, they only accept about 100 students a year. But since I’m doing terrible the second half of my junior year, they want to send me to a normal hs for my senior year. Which I’ve come to terms is a better option for me now, as It is 99% easier than this hell hole, doing highschool and college. 

But I’m afraid if I don’t learn to avoid these cycles that I’m going to get myself in financial trouble once I enter college after highschool. And how to avoid reacting with fight or flight to stress, most of the time I react with shut down mode/avoid everything and everyone. x.x which doesn’t sound healthy and makes me feel like I don’t have a backbone. 

My apologies if this is a long post."
DawnSunset,ISTP,"I’m getting so frustrated with my weight not going down even though I’ve been eating around 1300 for a month now 

I’m 5’4, 179 pounds 

I was down to 135 pounds about 2 years ago but I was eating very little amount even less than 1200 sometimes and sure enough that’s the reason I couldn’t keep it up. Anyway during quarantine I gained a bit of weight and unable to lose it. I tried it a few months ago and quickly got frustrated with the inability to lose any weight and gave up but I’m trying once again but without starving myself like before. And I’ve steadily been tracking for about a month now and just fluctuating between 178-180. And for anyone that says I’m not counting my calories right I’m not eating enough to be gaining instead of losing, trust me."
DawnSunset,ISTP,"I think I might be depressed but I can’t fkn tell cause I’ve always go through high and low cycle all the time. This one has been one of the lowest and particularly hard due to recent relationship problem and family issues mixed in with the quarantining.

I don’t enjoy the things I used to anymore, I don’t have motivation to do anything and I don’t enjoy being alone at all. Being alone with just my thoughts is painful and I constantly need to vent to someone (usually ends up being my online friends). I constantly need to talk to someone and while it may help me feel better in the moment, I’m back to being lonely and sad afterwards. 

I feel like my inferior Fe is making me extremely emotionally sensitive recently, I feel deep emotions CONSTANTLY and it’s mentally and emotionally exhausting. Heck I wish I could cry all the time but I can’t even do that cause my I feel like my tears and emotions aren’t even connected. 

I’m so so tired and exhausted and frustrated that I can’t do anything to help myself feel better. I don’t know if I’m doing the right thing by seeking ppl to vent all the time to or if it’ll be better if I just close everyone off and disappear and deal with my own problems/thoughts myself. I’d appreciate any input or insight, anything at all!!"
DawnSunset,ISTP,"I know a few ISFJs in my own life and I was curious how other people’s relationship with these types are like. Especially if you dated/date one. 

That is the relationship like, are you able to understand each other and connect with each other?
Is the relationship boring/exciting etc..?

I’m curious about friendships with them as well, so feel free to mention any. 




Ps. don’t worry I’m not trying to categorize people into their personality types and limiting my interactions  because of their typee. I just am just curious about how people’s own experience/relationship looks like."
DawnSunset,ISTP,"
I really do. How do I break free from you? I try and try to distance myself but I know that the truth is that I want you. Distancing myself from you is painful and trying to connect with you is even more painful.
I’m jealous that I can’t have your attention, your time, affection and love. It’s selfish because I know we can’t be together in the end but I still want you, and it hurts."
DawnSunset,ISTP,"Are you going to miss me if I don’t talk to you? Because I know I am, even though I’m doing this for me. To rid myself of my greatest distraction, which is you."
DawnSunset,ISTP,"I don’t want to talk to you ever again but deep down I know that it’s not true. If you spoke to me again, it would completely reverse my desire to ignore and forget you. I simultaneously want to be free of your thoughts and to be able to talk like how we used to. Loving you feels like a bittersweet pain that I’m addicted to."
DawnSunset,ISTP,"A few weeks ago, I made a post about going through cycles of underachieving and overachieving where for a period of time I do extremely well on all areas of my life and then for the next period of time, I’m in the dumps.

 I’ve just fallen into the underachieving phase, which is a huge problem because I have missing work for my college which is starting to pile up. If I don’t pull myself through, I’m going to have a lot of TROUBLE. But for some reason, I can’t seem to get myself to start! Like I know it’s unreasonable but a part of me wants to sleep and escape worry-some things instead of facing my issues. And the more I push this off the deeper I’ll fall into this pit-hole of anxiety until there’s nowhere to go but to pick myself up. Repeating the cycle. But I need to solve it ASAP and can’t just go let myself go through the cycle, this time. 

I really need help or advice on how to get out cycles like this, or what you think causes them."
DawnSunset,ISTP,"I watched this movie during the early 2010s on the channel called “THIS” where it always showed old movies. I can’t remember this particular movie’s plot but the parts that I do remember are that there were a group of either moving settlers, barbaric people or pirates, I don’t know which. And they had a captive young woman, she was wearing a long dress like the 1800s, except raggedy and dirty looking. She was forcefully tied to a wooden wheel and thrown knives at. 

Now, the only other thing I remember is that there was a swamp full of alligators and 2 men who were trying to capture the lady again or something."
TuffTitti,INFJ,"Too many people are in denial about their own anger. These are the  same people who are often confused about what they want in life.  Underneath anger are not only hurts but also wants.

There is purpose to this maligned emotion. Anger does not have to be  big, bad and ugly. If you are someone who feels lost and unsure then it would benefit you to notice when you are annoyed or mildly irritated,  then figure out the want buried beneath.

Anger has meaning as an emotional tool. It proclaims “I am important  too.” Most people take it too far, “I am the only one that matters.”  Connecting with anger can help anxious people take up more space instead  of silently grinding their teeth. If they learn to speak up they are a  part of preventing a relationship from being lopsided and unfair.

Swallowing your anger and using denial is a way to erase yourself."

obelixthegaul,INTP,"Hello ISTPs. I (33M) have an ISTP (24F) neighbour who I am developing feelings for. 

We've lived next to each other for a couple of years and spoken here and there (usually to co-ordinate weed), but the last couple of months we've been hanging out more often. We eat pizza and watch movies or listen to music and chat about stuff until early hours of the morning.

We have also started sharing things about our lives with each other; eg, she had some annoying drama with some friends that I gave her advice on, she tells me about mental health struggles she has, and she consoled me when my dad died recently.

She came out of a long term relationship a few months ago and is still single, stays home 7 days a week except for work and as far as I know, no other dudes are hanging out with her.

With the data out of the way: problem is, we are both IxTPs and I have no idea whether this is just casual and friendly for her, or she might be developing feelings too. Probably, she has no idea about mine either, because I don't flirt either, even though I have to suppress imagining all the things I would do to her if I got the chance whenever we're together.

It's not as simple as ""just ask"" because we're neighbours, and I do value her friendship so I don't want to jump the gun or break things.

My questions for you are: a) does the fact that she wants to chill frequently, and opens up about the inside of her head, increase the odds that the feelings are mutual or does it indicate nothing?

And b) if a friend expresses feelings that you don't reciprocate how likely are you to pull back from the friendship?"

Could just be allergies but I can't tell."
That_One_ISFJ,ISFJ,"Hey All,

I understand very well the insomnia issues that plague many of us. When I first tested positive for COVID, during week 2, I lost my ability to sleep for several days. Every time I was about to nod off, I would have a hypnic jerk and it would wake me back up. I could always tell when one was about to approach because there was this...it's hard to describe...""wave""-like sensation that went through my body right before it would happen. My family and I celebrated when they caught me napping on the couch one night and we had realized that that nightmare was ending.

I got the vaccine 2 weeks ago and it flared up a bunch of symptoms, and this one came right back a couple days ago, but it's a different version this time. Instead of a hypnic jerk, I just have this intense feeling of dread in my chest and throat, and then that wave-like sensation comes back and floods my whole body. Then I have to wake up because it's a very uncomfortable, alerting feeling. I was able to sleep through it one night this week, but other than that I struggle to sleep and it happens about a couple minutes each time after I close my eyes.

Anybody else dealing with this or has also dealt with it? Is my body just super anxious right now so my nervous system is out of control? I keep telling myself over and over ""you've beaten this before"" to try to stay calm."
That_One_ISFJ,ISFJ,"Hi All,

11 months, 30M here. Still dealing with a wide variety of symptoms: Vision changes, excess floaters, insomnia, fatigue, rapid heart rate, exercise intolerance, excessive sweating, tinnitus, brain fog, panic attacks/anxiety, and head pressure/nasal congestion.

I got the 1st dose of the Moderna shot on 6/7 and my body is basically doing a repeat of what I went through when I first got sick 11 months ago minus the loss of taste/smell. I still am running a slightly elevated temperature (99.4F) at 2 weeks; it took 3-4 weeks for me to get my temp back down to normal when I initially got infected.  


I think the scariest part right now is the severe insomnia set in again for the first time last night. I got 3 hours of sleep and every time I tried to fall asleep I would get this wave of anxiety through my body like I was being crushed or have a hypnic jerk. I initially went a whole week with only 1-2 hours/night when I first got sick. This is bringing back scary memories from last year and I had a nervous break down today. Praying it goes away and I don't have to go on hard sleeping pills to try to get through this. My family is away on vacation and I'm home alone and that's not helping me stay calm being by myself.

Heart rate has been very bad, and the constant palpitations I've had since the beginning got a little worse (I can see my pulse in my neck, chest, and feel it when I'm lying down). Jumped from 50BPM in bed to 120BPM while walking to the bathroom, and I had to get on my knees and take deep breaths to calm down.  


Can anyone give me hope that I'm not making a big mistake here? I'm waiting in line at urgent care right now to see if a doctor can help me in any way, but I'm very frightened and can't calm down."
That_One_ISFJ,ISFJ,"To make a long story short, I've recently developed a chronic illness and an ISTP friend/coworker has been very supportive about it at work in his calm, unassuming ISTP way, and I wanted to say thank you somehow, but I feel that words won't suffice. His birthday is coming up and I decided to get him a gift card for the in-game currency of his favorite video game, a gift card to his favorite store, and a little figurine from his favorite video game. I figured these would be simple things that would be useful to him, and would allow him to choose what he wants.

I've read several other gift posts here and it sounds like ISTPs aren't comfortable with gifts to an extent. Is there anything I can do to make things more comfortable? I'm trying to show genuine appreciation in a way that fits the level of support I've received...and I'm hoping it will help keep our friendship alive.

I have had a crush on a coworker for a while. We've flirted here and there during our shifts, really fun. I've had good opportunities but I left them since we were coworkers. I might be moving jobs soon so I thought I'd give it a shot.

For context when we talk she can be flirty and sarcastic, but she has a smile/is happy. Not cold. 

Would you guys appreciate a happy birthday text message? I was thinking of sending one with an inside joke/kinda subtle flirty message to her. Nothing crazy. Just happy birthday and an inside joke. 

I was wondering if you guys would appreciate this/should I send one or not?

I used to be a huge asshole when it came to flirting and what not but I've reformed and I'm trying to change my ways. 

Thanks

Edit: Ok thanks guys I sent the message 💪

Edit 2: she replied after two hours ""Haha thank you pjcdp! I'm gonna remember that promised 1/2 inch ""

I made a joke about gifting her 1/2 inch of height since she is on the shorter side (5ft)

Edit: sent another flirty message, she responded a few hours back,not really flirty. All in all, not the best outcome but mission accomplished thanks guys"

Before I go on, please keep in mind that these are just my thoughts and that you’re welcome to think what you like. Theorizing about fiction is meant to be fun, and if anything in this post offends you (ex. maybe you love the later seasons! That’s totally cool!) please know that I didn’t mean for it to and I apologize.

Okay, here we go:

In seasons 1-3, which are generally thought to be the best ones, each plot point flows seamlessly with the next. Everything is part of a bigger picture, and the plot is driven forward by each character’s actions.

Take season 1 for example.

Stefan comes back to town because from his character’s standpoint he wants to get to know Elena, and from a writer’s standpoint he’s there to introduce her (and therefore us) to the world of the supernatural. Damon and Anna come back to town because they’re trying to open the tomb and rescue Katherine and Pearl respectively. John and Isobel kill the tomb vamps because Katherine wants them to, so that when she comes back to town she doesn’t have a headache to deal with. But why does Katherine want to come back? For Elena and the moonstone, because she wants to use them to undo a curse laid on a man who’s been hunting her for 500 years in order to possibly gain his pardon. Each character is an active participant in their own life, their motives are clear, and everything is done by them on purpose, which drives the plot forward in a natural way.

Elena feeds into the Salvatores’ story which feeds into Katherine’s story which feeds into the story of Elijah and Klaus and the rest of the Originals, but it’s all still part of the same big picture. From the beginning, Elena was directly related to the ending; to Klaus and breaking his curse. The first 3 seasons are just about her getting to him, and then about exploring the Originals’ dynamics with each other, the MF gang, and explaining why they are the way they are. But even that is still part of the same *bigger* picture: how Elena is directly related to the existence of vampires.

At the end of season 3, that picture is finished. That story ends. So we need to come up with a new story. As much as I dislike the cure storyline (for reasons I’ve previously outlined in [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheVampireDiaries/comments/oc9eg0/worst_storyline/h3tppcf/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf&context=3) comment) I recognize its potential and the opportunity it presented to tie what we already had into a massive, all-encompassing story that further explains the lore of the world and Elena’s importance as a doppelgänger.

This starts off reasonably well. Connor, Hayley, and Shane make sense in their actions and why they’re interacting with the MF gang. The idea of Silas and Amara feels a bit strange to me because I think that Stefan and Elena being drawn to each other through magic is cheesy as hell (I would dislike this for any duo that is not a platonic Elena + Bonnie; that would explain Emily, Ayana, and Qetsiyah, which is actually a needed thing), and also was it really necessary for Stefan to be a doppelgänger too? But whatever, I can look past it.

It’s after Silas shows his true face that things start to really fall apart.

Travelers. This idea is not in and of itself bad, but Nadia meeting Matt and Rebekah feels incredibly coincidental to me. What are the odds that she would randomly meet the gateway to her mother without trying to, when she had no luck for 500 years *while* she was trying to? Klaus would be jealous as hell. This isn’t the most egregious example of this (and could be argued to be as coincidental as Elena being born in Mystic Falls), but it marks the beginning of a pattern that I believe was one of the most detrimental things to happen to the show: plot points come to be because of coincidence; not choice.

Elena’s father was part of an evil medical society that experimented on vampires? That sounds incredibly interesting. But hey, isn’t it kind of a coincidence that Damon was also tortured by them decades ago and made a best friend there? And that none of this is important to the story at large?

Oh, and isn’t it an even bigger coincidence how that best friend was turned by Stefan and Damon’s secret vampire mother and just so happened to befriend one of her sons later on in his life—er, unlife? Did Lily send Enzo to look after her boys and that’s why he was captured? Or, even more interestingly, did Enzo get captured on purpose so he could get close to Damon in a way that would bind them together for all eternity? Does he feel so indebted to Lily, did she manipulate him to such a great extent, that he would be willing to sacrifice decades of his time and sanity just to please her? Nah. None of this happens for a reason. It’s all just coincidence.

Side note: from what I remember, the prison world and Gemini Coven stuff was mostly okay, except for Julie Plec thinking that gay people proclaim, “I’m gay!” every five seconds and Delena being dumb dummies by not meeting Bonnie halfway when she was trapped. Still doesn’t feed into a bigger picture though.

Going back to the Lily thing, you mean to tell me that Alaric just so happened to find the incredibly rare and special Phoenix Stone that just so happened to be in the state he was visiting that just so happened to be a major part of Lily’s backstory that he *just so happened* to grab and take back with him to Mystic Falls? Sticking with Alaric, you mean to tell me that the intern he happened to hire just in time for all the Siren-Cade stuff to go down *just so happened* to have gone to Hell and *just so happened* to have important and well-timed information? Where did the Armory even come from? I honestly thought I missed a couple episodes where there was an “Enzo finding the Armory” subplot. Him finding it should have been a bigger deal. It just makes everything related to it feel out of place. But regardless…

Are you seeing what I’m seeing? Nothing is part of a bigger picture and nothing is connected through much more than coincidence, in a way that things in seasons 1-3 were not. It’s just one storyline that leads into another storyline that leads into another that could therefore go on forever, unlike the very clear and complete “origin of vampires” storyline that spanned the first three seasons. Seasons 5-8 are a straight line where seasons 1-3 were a set of matryoshka dolls. (Season 4 is a strange one because it has the beginnings of a matryoshka-like story structure but they never follow through with it.)

In my opinion, the show should have ended with Silas. They should have made him be more of a threat (dude just wanted to die after all these years, I mean c’mon, that’s the pitch for a comedy movie lol), Elena should have explored her history with him like she did with Katherine, and he should have been the final boss, not Cade. That would have been the most natural conclusion to the show. It started with Elena’s inherent connection to the supernatural as a doppelgänger, it should have ended with Elena’s inherent connection to the supernatural as a doppelgänger. That’s the story. That’s the heart of the show. Elena, Katherine, Tatia, and Amara, and their connections to each other being what has shaped so much of the supernatural world, and therefore the world as a whole. Dragging it out for 8 seasons by not keeping that in mind was a mistake.

**TL;DR:** The plot post-season 4 was mostly strung together by acts of happenstance rather than purpose, there is no big picture after Silas, and the show forgot that the Petrova women are the reason there was a show in the first place."
zuxxa,INFP,"I know this subreddit has gotten a ton of these types of posts before, but godDAMN do I love ISFJs. You’re sweet and kind and caring, and as an INFP I know all too well how it feels to be misunderstood when you don’t talk a million miles an hour within 5 minutes (or days…… or weeks 😅) of meeting someone. You’re not boring. You have an incredibly rich inner world and just need to feel safe in order to open up and be sociable. People who can’t see that don’t deserve you.

Also, you’re super smart, your sense of humor cracks me up, and you have this mystical ability to find a quick and simple solution to a problem that my daydreaming ass might not even consider until it’s too late.

Ugh, I just want to wrap you all up in a big, fluffy blanket, give you hot cocoa, and make sure you know that you deserve everything in life. Including your own care. It’s okay to put yourself first.

This was a quick, silly post, but even the toughest of you are too lovely, and I simply couldn’t resist ❤️

Have a beautiful day!"
zuxxa,INFP,"Like I'm sorry mom, you don't understand, I've been scouring the wikia for months so I don't get anything wrong, I fill my head with theories on characterization all day long, I've learned each character's speaking patterns, their birthdays, AND what their parents do for a living, I have my fanfic on my mind 24/7, I'm trying to fix plot holes that not even canon addressed, and I'm pretty sure I've made myself fall in love with a man that doesn't exist, so NO. I *don't* have time to dRaW tHe WaY i UsEd To.

zuxxa,INFP,"and your brain suddenly goes ""wow you named your OC *that??* What a garbage name. Scrap it. Start over. Trash."" Like bro it's a perfectly fine name, why are you like this? Who hurt you? Do you need to talk to someone?"
zuxxa,INFP,"Like you misspell 'couch' as 'counch' or something and for some reason it tickles you just right so for the next thirty seconds you're like 'haha *counch*' in the dumbest possible voice?

I do it unconsciously, but today I realized that it's indirectly helped me not take my work too seriously and has curbed my perfectionism. It keeps the hobby lighthearted and helps me remember that that's what writing fanfiction is meant to be: a hobby."
