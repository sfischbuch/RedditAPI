vivienne85,ENFP,I find myself easily get drawn into a fictional universe and imagine myself living in it. Now I wonder whether other ENFPs have the same tendency..😆

makeuleave,ENFP,"I'm aware in the beginning of the course it's said we should do the homework, submit it for feedback and go to the next lesson. However, in the ellipses homework, I noticed an extra difficulty to the point of my arm trembling in the middle of the line since it's not used to the movement, which led into drawings that looked like I wasn't even trying my best. My will to keep going and confidence also went down big time since it's only the beginning and I seem to be already struggling.

So, with all that stated, should I redo it (not to get the shapes perfectly, simply to get to the level I see other beginners are at), or is this instance common and I should just move on?"

makeuleave,ENFP,"I was reading some stuff over r/intj and got curious. I remember some kind of similar discussion happening a while ago here and it felt good to read about other experiences (esp. bad) that looked so much like my own.

I'm mostly looking for failed relationships stories and the hardships of being with an INTJ. I have been warned before that my past relationship with an INTJ must have been with a childish one but I can't know for sure, so I would like to hear from you guys if you're comfortable sharing."

EstivalEquinox,INFJ,"Hi there! I've actually seldom encounter ENTJs in my life. But I want to at least get a better understanding on how to spot them, and if I ever made a friend, what it might be like? 

I have so little understanding and experience with you guys that I wouldn't even know how to identify one. Heck, my co-worker one I couldn't identify until he took the test. I thought he was an introvert until I saw him get hyped around co-workers he's friends with. Then I remembered the last ENTJ I met (My Mom's old boss) was seemingly cold to her he got to know her. 

Part of me is asking since I'm doing a story with a female ENTJ as one of the 6 main characters. But she's based off my responsible and mostly mature ENTP.  Though I know about her, idk if she's truly ENTJ or if I'm hoping I figured out enough to convince myself she is. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

If it helps for how I might expect to interact with one of you guys I can try to summarize me?

I'm an INFJ female. More bubbly and socially warm compared to most. Improved on conflict skills but still sensitive to a point. Recognizes that I'm not a special snowflake that no one gets and ""Thinks in ways people just don't get"". :/ Believe me, I'm ashamed of that phase and still find pieces of it can show up in new ways. I'm a weird artist geeky INFJ, not a popular but nice blends in with normal society INFJ. 

&#x200B;

Thank you for your time!"

EstivalEquinox,INFJ,"Hey guys, I'm kinda curious about your experiences with making friends.

Do most of them adopt you (if you even let them do that), or do you approach most? 

Also what are their types if you know?

&#x200B;

I ask since my ISTP normally gets adopted (though wards most people since his instinct is to not trust), but I'm the only case I know of where...well as he put it ""You seemed harmless enough."". 

&#x200B;

Our friend group (that I mostly merged him into) is:

INFJ (F26) me

ISTP (M25) him

ENTP (F26)

ESFJ (M26)

ISFP (F26)

INFP (F24)

All of us have known each other for 7-8 years, minus the INFP who joined us two years after the rest of the group formed.  

He isn't very affectionate like most of the group (Happens when you get an ESFJ & ISFP who encourage the INFJ & INFP into cuddles, then get an ENTP who is chill with affection.) the poor guy had to deal with us. But since we respected his boundaries, he slowly started pat patting us on the head."

EstivalEquinox,INFJ,"Hi guys. I'm finishing up on the story mode, on chapter six (yes I know how it ends. I watched this game when it came out thinking I wouldn't enjoy playing it myself. Boy was I wrong.) 

But after I reach 100% I was hoping to start playing online. (At 72% right now) 

&#x200B;

The thing is I heard there are different roles and such. So beyond the standard tips for new people, are there standard tips for someone who is generally an empath/likes to help people sorts? 

Don't get me wrong if you're a jerk to me I may still retaliate, but generally I like the ""don't hurt innocent folks"" mentality and I'm a ""give someone the benefit of the doubt"" sorts. 

&#x200B;

Gameplay wise I like:

\-Hunting (couldn't do it irl but I love the challenge and tracking)/ observing animals 

\-Exploring 

\-Bonding with horses/discovering horse breeds

\-Clothing and playing with outfits

\-Saying hi to every human that exists

Oh yes, and this game has served as a great way to overcome my childhood trauma with guns. So I'm trying to take an interest in learning about them.

EstivalEquinox,INFJ,"Hi there\~

My brother just turned 24 today. He's non verbal though he understands things to a good extent and is 100% physically okay. He loves his tablet, and we just got him an upgrade. But besides his favorite game Happy Color (A fill in the numbers w/ color app that he'll play for hours) and the Jigsaw puzzle he occasionally enjoys, we're not sure what else to add on. 

He enjoys scrolling through calendars on the app as well (loves calendars period, and numbering things.) 

Sometimes he likes taking photos, but he never really got too deep into photography (we explored this once. He wasn't too interested beyond taking photos on the tablet itself.)

EstivalEquinox,INFJ,"Alright, my best friend told me I might just have to accept that I keep falling for INFPs. I'm still scared of my past relationship with a really toxic INFP (and yes I was pretty toxic back then too.)

I get frustrated every time I crush on a person and find out they're INFP, real or fictional. It's like I can't control it. I suppose I'm scared of dating someone who avoids conflict or doesn't tell me when my behavior is bothering them. While there were many issues on both sides, this is what really shook me, and what I'm scared of if dating any INFP. 

&#x200B;

When I was dating my ex a lot of research I did online said the INFP x INFJ relationship often goes bad.

I know the MBTI isn't everything mind you.

But I keep falling for these guys and I just wanna get this chip off my shoulder, since it isn't fair to a potentially good INFP out there.

But besides his favorite game Happy Color (A fill in the numbers w/ color app that he'll play for hours) and the Jigsaw puzzle he occasionally enjoys, we're not sure what else to add on. 

He enjoys scrolling through calendars on the app as well (loves calendars period, and numbering things.) 

Sometimes he likes taking photos, but he never really got too deep into photography (we explored this once. He wasn't too interested beyond taking photos on the tablet itself.) 

Thank you for your time!"
EstivalEquinox,INFJ,"Alright, my best friend told me I might just have to accept that I keep falling for INFPs. I'm still scared of my past relationship with a really toxic INFP (and yes I was pretty toxic back then too.)

I get frustrated every time I crush on a person and find out they're INFP, real or fictional. It's like I can't control it. I suppose I'm scared of dating someone who avoids conflict or doesn't tell me when my behavior is bothering them. While there were many issues on both sides, this is what really shook me, and what I'm scared of if dating any INFP. 

&#x200B;

When I was dating my ex a lot of research I did online said the INFP x INFJ relationship often goes bad.

I know the MBTI isn't everything mind you.

But I keep falling for these guys and I just wanna get this chip off my shoulder, since it isn't fair to a potentially good INFP out there.

\*Sighs\* I guess also I just took a test for what I'd like in a lot of aspects and well... you can guess the results.

&#x200B;

Also can you guys just stop being smart and charming?"
EstivalEquinox,INFJ,"Hey, I'm an INFJ (26F) you may have seen poking around on here sometimes.  I recognize this is long, but I tend not to like leaving out details, and even then I've still compressed it to a point.

*My ISTJ Mother is my hero. In summary she:*

\- Held the family together financially by working super hard jobs even though some of them didn't treat her well. Eventually found one that did after forever. (Her parents raised her to think she'd be a housewife. They did apologize for this, but it made navigating work insanely hard when Dad couldn't work anymore.)

\- Held the family together when her Husband (ESFJ, M58) was un-functional with psychosis. Supported him until in 2016 we found a doctor who helped him get back to his true self.

\- Held the family together while I was a kid and my brother (ISFJ, M22) destroyed everything due to his autism. (He would kick walls, scream, smear poop as a child. Now he's a saint who loves helping people, and is very by the rules.

\- Helped me when I had abusive friendships in middle school, and helped me navigate mental health problems as an adult that crippled me until they got treated. (Same Doctor as who saved my Dad.)

\- She allows me to stay here while I pay off my student debts. In fact she insists on it. I try hard to help her out to say thank you.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

***Here's the actual Situation/Concern***

We try so hard to thank her and make things easier on her, or to treat her. But she's so so so hard on herself. We've made progress in ensuring her that her needs are just as important as ours, and YES please please you can/should get some new socks that don't have holes and a better bed for yourself! (She still struggles with this. We force her to get things she needs more.)

&#x200B;

But she still gets upset and even emotional when she messes up. If she speaks matter of fact and with little emotion, and Dad gets sensitive thinking she's mad at him, she'll cry and berate herself for hurting his feelings.

We tell her we know she didn't mean to, and she wasn't trying to be mean. Dad's just extra sensitive. But she'll yell at herself for not being emotionally sweet to Dad all the time. She may even go online after crying and try to research how to be more emotionally sensitive/kind.

&#x200B;

***Here's what happened today that made me post this:***

Right now I've caught a cold. My throat is hurting and whatnot. She was out so I asked her for a few supplies. She got 2/3, but forgot caught drops. When I asked for them she got so frustrated with herself stating ""Dang it I should have known that!""

She was trying to figure out bills that needed to be payed and other things at the same time. So this may have factored on top of this. But this was the straw that made her upset at herself.

I replied ""Hey! Be nice to (Mom's Name) I like her!"" She sighed and banged her head lightly on a piece of equipment. I once again said ""Don't be hard on yourself. We're all humans and I love you."" But she was still miffed that she missed something. She sighed and forced herself to go out again to get them even though I said she didn't have to.

&#x200B;

Some of these things are small that she gets upset with herself over, and some of them are a tad bigger. I know her type of ISTJ values emotional harmony and stability because it equals security, which security is a practical value. So I recognize she may be far more emotional than the average ISTJ.

&#x200B;

**But she wants her life and our lives to be as such, but beats herself  verbally  when she can't keep things ""perfect'.**

But life isn't perfect and she doesn't have to be either. I often have to remind her that just because things are bad now doesn't mean they don't change. They always change and she's always survived the past struggles. So she will make it through this one.

&#x200B;

**Do any other ISTJs have these struggles?**

Beyond these situations she's not very emotional externally. In fact my ENxP friend was surprised to hear she does this, since it's so different from the calm rational lady she knows.

&#x200B;

yuknome,ENFP,"Curious person here. A previous post sparked a question for me and so I must ask! Wondering what types of intelligence INTJs seem to appreciate in other people the most or even find attractive. 
And do you find it's more comfortable, or even important to you, that others share your same kind of intelligence? Or do you tend to appreciate anyone who can follow along, even if they aren't as measurably knowledgable? Would love some insight /o/"

I just want to say He is truly our faithful and loving Father who will meet our needs and listen to each hurt, and for sure it is true that He makes all things beautiful in His time. I know things probably wont be perfect right away but I have such strong faith He is still working a good work in our family/relationships.

yellowdaisycoffee,ENFP,"I wanted to make this post to encourage anybody who has been too scared to get their COVID-19 vaccine! 

I was so nervous to go out and get it, and expressed that in [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/emetophobia/comments/ofk6mr/pfizer_vaccine_terrified/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share) post the other day. Well I did it yesterday, with a fear of needles as well, and I'm fine! The needle hurt a little but I have had worse shots (e.g. HPV and Meningitis), and I have literally no scary symptoms. My arm is ridiculously sore to the point that it is basically useless (it hurts too much to lift it), but that's a small price to pay and I think it will be better tomorrow. My brother got the vaccine with me, and he is fine too, just very sore.

I chose to get Pfizer because I've heard good things about people's reaction to it overall, and my other siblings had no negative reaction to it (my mom got Moderna and did feel a bit off). I really encourage you to check with your relatives about which shot they got, and how they felt, because that can be very encouraging. 

In summary, I was as scared as some of you are, I did it, I survived, and I'm completely okay. It actually feels good to know you're going to be safer from the virus soon, it's freeing (and I'm saying this as someone who actually enjoyed being in quarantine). Go for it!"

yellowdaisycoffee,ENFP,"Hi all,

So I have been taking Zoloft (100mg) for around 4-5 years now. Before I was taking it, I would say I had high functioning anxiety, but I had been going through a very bad period that forced me to finally get help. I've never known whether my meds were helping or not though. At the time, I couldn't tell if I was feeling better or the same, but I took the meds anyway and kept going.

Recently, however, my anxiety has been really bad and I don't know why. I have been having frequent anxiety attacks for no discernible reason, or just general feelings of anxiety that make it a little harder to enjoy anything. For example, I will feel anxious while watching a movie and end up spending the whole movie trying to keep my anxiety down. Or I wake up anxious. Or I get so anxious in general I have to go lie down somewhere alone to try and relax. I try to pinpoint the trigger every time, but I come up with very little. Yesterday, I actually had one of the top 3 worst panic attacks of my life, and I couldn't come up with much reason for it. I was in the car which makes me nervous sometimes. That's all.

Basically, I want to know if this is normal while taking medication that works? Or if I need to talk to my psychiatrist about switching to something else? (And yes I am seeking out a new therapist :))"

yellowdaisycoffee,ENFP,"Hi all,

So I have been taking Zoloft (100mg) for around 4-5 years now. Before I was taking it, I would say I had high functioning anxiety, but I had been going through a very bad period that forced me to finally get help. I've never known whether my meds were helping or not though. At the time, I couldn't tell if I was feeling better or the same, but I took the meds anyway and kept going.

Recently, however, my anxiety has been really bad and I don't know why. I have been having frequent anxiety attacks for no discernible reason, or just general feelings of anxiety that make it a little harder to enjoy anything. For example, I will feel anxious while watching a movie and end up spending the whole movie trying to keep my anxiety down. Or I wake up anxious. Or I get so anxious in general I have to go lie down somewhere alone to try and relax. I try to pinpoint the trigger every time, but I come up with very little. Yesterday, I actually had one of the top 3 worst panic attacks of my life, and I couldn't come up with much reason for it. I was in the car which makes me nervous sometimes. That's all.

Basically, I want to know if this is normal while taking medication that works? Or if I need to talk to my psychiatrist about switching to something else? (And yes I am seeking out a new therapist :))"
yellowdaisycoffee,ENFP,"I'm not really sure how to find something like this even though I know it exists, so I want to know if anyone has used them and if they thought it was worth it."
yellowdaisycoffee,ENFP,"This seems like a miniscule accomplishment but I was feeling extremely n* this evening, and I didn't panic! I got a little anxious a few times, but I immediately distracted myself with a phone game and it worked. I didn't let my phobia make me feel worse for once, and I got past the experience without any v*ing 

It isn't a huge achievement but it gives me hope that I can climb out of this fear."
yellowdaisycoffee,ENFP,"I wanted to make this post to encourage anybody who has been too scared to get their COVID-19 vaccine! 

I was so nervous to go out and get it, and expressed that in [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/emetophobia/comments/ofk6mr/pfizer_vaccine_terrified/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share) post the other day. Well I did it yesterday, with a fear of needles as well, and I'm fine! The needle hurt a little but I have had worse shots (e.g. HPV and Meningitis), and I have literally no scary symptoms. My arm is ridiculously sore to the point that it is basically useless (it hurts too much to lift it), but that's a small price to pay and I think it will be better tomorrow. My brother got the vaccine with me, and he is fine too, just very sore.

I chose to get Pfizer because I've heard good things about people's reaction to it overall, and my other siblings had no negative reaction to it (my mom got Moderna and did feel a bit off). I really encourage you to check with your relatives about which shot they got, and how they felt, because that can be very encouraging. 

In summary, I was as scared as some of you are, I did it, I survived, and I'm completely okay. It actually feels good to know you're going to be safer from the virus soon, it's freeing (and I'm saying this as someone who actually enjoyed being in quarantine). Go for it!"
yellowdaisycoffee,ENFP,"Hi everybody! My emetophobia relapsed over the pandemic and it is the worst it has been in years. I basically can't leave the house without a panic attack.

I read this somewhere, when you're approaching someone for advice it's much better to give them the bare bones of a situation as clearly as you can, rather than overly explaining it. It's almost as if providing more information pollutes or confuses them from their original stance. Ah, the efficiency with information.....if only my Te could take the reins more  (-∧-；)

I guess the consumption of information made me think of how we as humans tend to be more appreciative of fewer choices, as opposed to being handed lots of options. This sounds like a very general thing though. Maybe it's the relationship with this spectrum where the types land, from utter discomfort to a mild annoyance.

What are your habits or preferences when faced with choices?"

Now I am unsure which one to choose as I can't guaranteed when since it's up to the University and I have asked the embassy what this mean
They then proceed to tell me if I am a regular or non regular student. What I know is that non regular student mean I have to take 6 month Japanese language. 

Other than that I am hecking confused as the non regular have an non regular time framed.

Please explain it to me how does this scholarship works.
In my mind it goes like this for me 

Got accepted, arrived in Japan, take the compulsory 6 months Japanese language( my Japanese is very rusty) and then proceed my PhD for 3 years ,accumulating a total years of 3 years and 6 months."

krizantemum,ENFP,"I feel like the more days past, the more I see how awful humanity is. And due to that, I became more careless, cruel and prone to manipulating people. My morals, inner judge is just dying. I have a great cognitive empathy, but I feel like my emotional and  compassionate empathy has just shut itself off. I had a hope about evolving humanity to better, but I realized we are all just in a loop, the view inside the loop changes, but the consequences are similar. My general view was to not hurt anyone because I would feel remorse, speak up if there is wrong, only be friends with people respectful, fit into your morals. But now, I do not hurt anyone if I want to, because I know if this will cause a loop it is a big trouble to me and waste of time, be friends with people who crush my morals because I don't create a real emotional bond between them and me, I feel like I really don't care even if they swear to my existence, they are just objects for me to spend my time.

But there are people I still love and care about.

I have not been always like this. Probably my country's situation caused this. Hate towards nonbelievers, LGBTQ, literally women's existence and so on... **I have been discriminated and caused to feel unsafe countless times by my people**. They have always talked about raping women, slaughtering LGBTQ and nonbelievers. Politicians literally provoked this. I have watched my country to lost its identity. I really started to hate people, I have never felt hate and never understood it, but now I do for who hates me for who I am. Seeing how people use Islam to provoke others around minorities (which in Quran there are literally verses about women being treated like second class citizens compared to men, killing non-believers etc. but until 10 years ago, people were understanding humanity is evolving around time and we have to respect each other to live together. However, not anymore as it seems. I have respect who does not threaten my existence).

I feel like an actual robot now. Just programmed to survive.  I have lost my identity, big smile and dreaming self. I am just a robot works, when fails beats itself, hates itself even more when realizes it has depression, something to get on its way. Even dares to destroy itself if it gets on its way."

krizantemum,ENFP,"Hello! I(F19) have just started uni this year after 2 years of preparation for the big exam, and I found out I have been bottling up my emotions for nearly 3 years and having intense complete breakdowns and meanwhile pandemic is making it even worse.

I am currently on computer engineering major, I chose this one because my big brothers is a great engineer and could help me, otherwise the only thing I have ever wanted was to be an animator, but whenever I told this to my family they would always say ""This place is Turkey, you will be unemployed."" and they were right, so I choose CENG to leave this hell like country as soon as possible.

I feel suicidal since I was in middle school. But whenever I told them to my parents, they would always get angry with me, my mom said ""If you kill yourself, I will call you a wh**e when you are dead."" and if I fail even a bit, there were always fights, and my parents would always be sure to show me they won't respect and love me otherwise, so I connected being loved to being successful. I have passed English preparation exam right away and started from 1st year of university.

I started bottling things up at last year of high school. Because I should just be a machine with success, whenever I have failed people would be angry, disappointed or looking at me with pity. I was working solid 12 hours a day, feeling terrible mentally, nobody helped so I got a anxiety attack while I was in exam and I could not get ""the grade"" so I would be in the same boat with my big brothers. And yeah I have always though they were smart and I was dumb, because one of my big brothers would accuse my lying whenever I did something ""smart"", we have a huge age gap so I could not catch up with their discussions when I was a kid.

Tried one year more, then pandemic hit, they messed up with exam's system, most people got the same grade it was like s**t. And the funny thing is, I really did not care which uni I would get in actually. Because I really don't care about coding.  I was swimming, painting, writing but never anything related to coding interested me.

And now, at first it was okay. My grades were amazing, 3gpa, new friends etc. Then, those new friends gaslighted me, my mom again had complete mental breakdowns in living room several times like it was in my gap year. I started therapy, my therapist told me to see a psychiatrist at the same time. I got my prescription but every person on this family for all the years told me it is a stigma, these meds are bad. Did not use them, and for my therapist to not think I am depressed and force me to use meds I bottled up literally EVERYTHING. And my coping mechanism with everything was to EAT. I am eating everything avalible not thinking about my health, my body etc. I even feel like the body on the mirror is not mine. I can't recognize myself anymore. I am no longer joyful, strong, creative swimmer girl anymore.

I seriously can't take it anymore. People always told me everything would get better but it is always getting worse. I can't even recognize myself."

But now, I do not hurt anyone if I want to, because I know if this will cause a loop it is a big trouble to me and waste of time, be friends with people who crush my morals because I don't create a real emotional bond between them and me, I feel like I really don't care even if they swear to my existence, they are just objects for me to spend my time.

But there are people I still love and care about.

I have not been always like this. Probably my country's situation caused this. Hate towards nonbelievers, LGBTQ, literally women's existence and so on... **I have been discriminated and caused to feel unsafe countless times by my people**. They have always talked about raping women, slaughtering LGBTQ and nonbelievers. Politicians literally provoked this. I have watched my country to lost its identity. I really started to hate people, I have never felt hate and never understood it, but now I do for who hates me for who I am. Seeing how people use Islam to provoke others around minorities (which in Quran there are literally verses about women being treated like second class citizens compared to men, killing non-believers etc. but until 10 years ago, people were understanding humanity is evolving around time and we have to respect each other to live together. However, not anymore as it seems. I have respect who does not threaten my existence).

I feel like an actual robot now. Just programmed to survive.  I have lost my identity, big smile and dreaming self. I am just a robot works, when fails beats itself, hates itself even more when realizes it has depression, something to get on its way. Even dares to destroy itself if it gets on its way."

krizantemum,ENFP,"Hello! I(F19) have just started uni this year after 2 years of preparation for the big exam, and I found out I have been bottling up my emotions for nearly 3 years and having intense complete breakdowns and meanwhile pandemic is making it even worse.

I am currently on computer engineering major, I chose this one because my big brothers is a great engineer and could help me, otherwise the only thing I have ever wanted was to be an animator, but whenever I told this to my family they would always say ""This place is Turkey, you will be unemployed."" and they were right, so I choose CENG to leave this hell like country as soon as possible.

I feel suicidal since I was in middle school. But whenever I told them to my parents, they would always get angry with me, my mom said ""If you kill yourself, I will call you a wh**e when you are dead."" and if I fail even a bit, there were always fights, and my parents would always be sure to show me they won't respect and love me otherwise, so I connected being loved to being successful. I have passed English preparation exam right away and started from 1st year of university.

I started bottling things up at last year of high school. Because I should just be a machine with success, whenever I have failed people would be angry, disappointed or looking at me with pity. I was working solid 12 hours a day, feeling terrible mentally, nobody helped so I got a anxiety attack while I was in exam and I could not get ""the grade"" so I would be in the same boat with my big brothers. And yeah I have always though they were smart and I was dumb, because one of my big brothers would accuse my lying whenever I did something ""smart"", we have a huge age gap so I could not catch up with their discussions when I was a kid.

Tried one year more, then pandemic hit, they messed up with exam's system, most people got the same grade it was like s**t. And the funny thing is, I really did not care which uni I would get in actually. Because I really don't care about coding.  I was swimming, painting, writing but never anything related to coding interested me.

And now, at first it was okay. My grades were amazing, 3gpa, new friends etc. Then, those new friends gaslighted me, my mom again had complete mental breakdowns in living room several times like it was in my gap year. I started therapy, my therapist told me to see a psychiatrist at the same time. I got my prescription but every person on this family for all the years told me it is a stigma, these meds are bad. Did not use them, and for my therapist to not think I am depressed and force me to use meds I bottled up literally EVERYTHING. And my coping mechanism with everything was to EAT. I am eating everything avalible not thinking about my health, my body etc. I even feel like the body on the mirror is not mine. I can't recognize myself anymore. I am no longer joyful, strong, creative swimmer girl anymore.

Other_Broccoli,ENFP,"Hi all,

I'm looking for a travel bag for the Celestron AstroMaster 80EQ. I want to carry it safely and conveniently. And by that I mean all its parts: the tripod, the equatorial mount, the telescope tube, the knobs, oculars, motordrive and counterweights. I've been looking online but it seems to me all the travel bags for this telescope are for the tube only. Maybe I'm wrong about that but because of covid I can't go to the store.

I would just like to take it with me when we go discover the dark skies of Europe (for example in the south centre of France between Clermont-Ferrand and Limoges). 

Thanks in advance for your two cents on this.

PS. Yesterday I got hooked on my new hobby. We were able to see the moon in such amazing detail. Far beyond what my little telescope I used to own when I was 12 years old could do. We also saw Sirius, Betelgeuse and Procyon. We had seen Rigel, Polaris and the Pleiades before, but it was for more strenuous and the nights were way colder then. Let me just say I really look forward to clear summer night skies."

Other_Broccoli,ENFP,"So my girlfriend and I were watching a film today. We were planning on viewing the moon and some stars later tonight with our telescope. We bought the thing not even a month ago and already got to see some stars. But the clear nights were cold and we were new to gazing so it was cool, but not as cool as I had hoped. Back to today: we had just returned from a walk and some chill time in the park. My girlfriend looked up from the film and yelled: ""wow, look at the moon!"" It was amazing. I decided we had to look through the telescope. It was brilliant. The moon was enchanting, the stars where shining brighter each minute in the dusk. We got to see Sirius, Procyon and Betelgeuse. We are hooked. What a great hobby and the best money ever spent! :)

The movie we were watching: deadpool. Got to say I enjoyed the moon and stars more."

It is with great disappointment that I, the leader of Air and Help Party, announce that I feel obligated to stop and dissolve the party. Unfortunately, due to personal business I cannot commit myself to co-lead our great country. Therefore from here on forth we do not longer exist.

I want to thank all our voters and supporters. I'm very sorry that I have to make this decision. I wish it wouldn't be necessary but you deserve an active government and at the moment I'm not able to grant you that.

Fivesix-789,ENFP,"Heartbreak opens onto the sunrise

For even breaking is opening

And I am broken

I’m open

Broken to the new light without 
pushing in

Open to the possibilities within, pushing out

See the love shine in through my cracks?

See the light shine out through me?

I am broken

I am open

I am broken open

See the love light shining through me

Shining through my cracks

Through the gaps

My spirit takes journey

My spirit takes flight

Could not have risen otherwise

And I am not running

I’m choosing

Running is not a choice from the breaking

Breaking is freeing

Broken is freedom

I am not broken

I’m free.

After reading this I was stunned. All my friendship so far in my life has been accidental friendships and mostly utility based. Where, I either run to them for emotional support or they come to me for emotional support. (Mutual) drama is how I made friends.
I also have issues with setting boundaries. Hence when  someone asks for a help I never say no. Because that is how I make friends. By extending myself. I was proud of being the friend people reached out to when they are in trouble. And I thought they will value me cz I was there for them. But sadly that was not the case. When I needed them in my times of trouble, they weren't there for me. It was heart breaking for me. Also I realized, that I over extend myself to others (no proper boundaries) and somehow expect the same from others cz I was there for them. But that didn't work. I ended up feeling used and resentful. 
This may come off as neediness I guess and neediness is not attractive. 

Besides, after honest self introspection I realised that I don't really care for a lot of people. I only like to help and want to help and I only am interested in their problems. Knowing each and everyone's different problems gave me insights into human psychology. It gave my Ne something to ponder upon. In short, most of the people are just information to me. 

I thought I was a great friend anyone could have. But I apparently don't bring anything to the table other than emotional support. This was a shocking reveletion to me. 

I had a conversation with an ENFJ friend who genuinely loves to have  friends and who has thousands of friends. She makes friends intentionally. She connects with people based on shared interests and values. She sees people as books and she told me that whether someone is just a short story or a novel depends on the person. She does not run to people only when she has a problem, nor does she over extends herself or involuntarily help people (and expects others to return the favour) 

I am going to make friends intentionally in future. I am going to reach out to people and show genuine care in their lives. Rather than only being interested in their problems and solving them. I am also going to approach friendships like romantic relationships. I want depth and dedication in friendships. I don't want 100s of superficial friends, rather I want just a couple of deep, reliable friends. Therefore I am going to seek people who also want what I want. I am going to find who seek deep friendships just like me and include them in my close circle."

profileT19,ENFP,"Please bear with me, and don't judge. 

So, you find a friend, get really close, and then you are really happy that you have found your tribe. 
You do your best to care for them, wish the very best for them. 

Then all of a sudden something happens. They do or say something that makes you feel uncomfortable - something feels totally wrong. But you can't really pin point what it is. But you can't move past that either. All her faults come to your mind, all the silent compromises you made for them comes into your mind. And then boom, you want to drop the friend and run away.

After reading this I was stunned. All my friendship so far in my life has been accidental friendships and mostly utility based. Where, I either run to them for emotional support or they come to me for emotional support. (Mutual) drama is how I made friends.
I also have issues with setting boundaries. Hence when  someone asks for a help I never say no. Because that is how I make friends. By extending myself. I was proud of being the friend people reached out to when they are in trouble. And I thought they will value me cz I was there for them. But sadly that was not the case. When I needed them in my times of trouble, they weren't there for me. It was heart breaking for me. Also I realized, that I over extend myself to others (no proper boundaries) and somehow expect the same from others cz I was there for them. But that didn't work. I ended up feeling used and resentful. 
This may come off as neediness I guess and neediness is not attractive. 

Besides, after honest self introspection I realised that I don't really care for a lot of people. I only like to help and want to help and I only am interested in their problems. Knowing each and everyone's different problems gave me insights into human psychology. It gave my Ne something to ponder upon. In short, most of the people are just information to me. 

I thought I was a great friend anyone could have. But I apparently don't bring anything to the table other than emotional support. This was a shocking reveletion to me. 

I had a conversation with an ENFJ friend who genuinely loves to have  friends and who has thousands of friends. She makes friends intentionally. She connects with people based on shared interests and values. She sees people as books and she told me that whether someone is just a short story or a novel depends on the person. She does not run to people only when she has a problem, nor does she over extends herself or involuntarily help people (and expects others to return the favour) 

I am going to make friends intentionally in future. I am going to reach out to people and show genuine care in their lives. Rather than only being interested in their problems and solving them. I am also going to approach friendships like romantic relationships. I want depth and dedication in friendships. I don't want 100s of superficial friends, rather I want just a couple of deep, reliable friends. Therefore I am going to seek people who also want what I want. I am going to find who seek deep friendships just like me and include them in my close circle."

BrightlyInvisible,ENFP,"* Hugs! I especially like hugs because they're so universally *good* across the spectrum of emotions. Someone's crying? Best way to help is to give them a hug! We're celebrating? Let's have a hug! 
* Music, singing, and dancing. What's even the difference between talking and singing? There isn't really one, *buttttt,* if someone talks in a very melodic way, we call it singing and everyone else in their vicinity feels inspired to... rhythmically flail about? And that's dancing! And those things release happiness chemicals in our brain! And I think that's very sweet of us.
* Facial expressions and body language. We totally take them for granted, but think of how cool it is that we outwardly show how we're feeling in a very detailed way so all the other humans can react accordingly. It really goes to show how much we depend on tiny social interactions.
* Dolls, stuffed animals, and how natural it is for children to take various objects and pretend they're sentient. I tend to like anything that exhibits just how social we naturally are. We *need* a pack. We need friends. We need family. And whenever we can't get enough of it, we play pretend. (Adult equivalent would probably be talking to oneself!)
* Our sense of beauty. We look flowers and sunsets and trees and waterfalls and ponds and our hearts beat just a little bit more contentedly. It evokes excitement! Joy! We love our home. We love being alive. We are aware of our own existence and we *love* it.
* The fact that we take so much pleasure from reproduction. As Nietzsche said, ""... in themselves the sexual feelings, are such that one human thereby gives pleasure to another human being through his delight; one does not encounter such beneficent arrangements too frequently in nature.""
* The fact that we wear clothes and put up paintings. Our proclivity to decorate is beautiful. 
* Our ability to visualize and imagine! I imagine we evolved to use this as a way to analyze possible outcomes of a situation, but now we daydream-- we can realistically put ourselves in any scenario or world we want. And my goodness, that is an incredible talent. 

Anyway, these are just the things I've been thinking about today! Feel free to add more in the comments! Have a fantastic day, my fellow optimists <3"

And those things release happiness chemicals in our brain! And I think that's very sweet of us.
* Facial expressions and body language. We totally take them for granted, but think of how cool it is that we outwardly show how we're feeling in a very detailed way so all the other humans can react accordingly. It really goes to show how much we depend on tiny social interactions.
* Dolls, stuffed animals, and how natural it is for children to take various objects and pretend they're sentient. I tend to like anything that exhibits just how social we naturally are. We *need* a pack. We need friends. We need family. And whenever we can't get enough of it, we play pretend. (Adult equivalent would probably be talking to oneself!)
* Our sense of beauty. We look flowers and sunsets and trees and waterfalls and ponds and our hearts beat just a little bit more contentedly. It evokes excitement! Joy! We love our home. We love being alive. We are aware of our own existence and we *love* it.
* The fact that we take so much pleasure from reproduction. As Nietzsche said, ""... in themselves the sexual feelings, are such that one human thereby gives pleasure to another human being through his delight; one does not encounter such beneficent arrangements too frequently in nature.""
* The fact that we wear clothes and put up paintings. Our proclivity to decorate is beautiful. 
* Our ability to visualize and imagine! I imagine we evolved to use this as a way to analyze possible outcomes of a situation, but now we daydream-- we can realistically put ourselves in any scenario or world we want. And my goodness, that is an incredible talent.

BrightlyInvisible,ENFP,"For anyone who doesn't know, the Liberation Pledge is essentially a pledge where you promise to

1. Live vegan
2. Decline to eat where animals are being eaten (I'm not sure if this only applies to meat, or dairy and other animal products as well)
3. Encourage others to take the pledge

[Here is its website](http://www.liberationpledge.com/)

I've seen a lot of different reactions to it, and my personal opinion as an abolitionist is that it's our responsibility to do what will be best for the animals. That means we have a delicate balance to maintain: on the one hand, we should do whatever we can to raise awareness and encourage others to go vegan. On the other, this pledge could come off as ""cultish"" or give vegans a bad look, so to speak. I think people will be less likely to go vegan if our reputation is a negative one. 

What do you all think? So curious to hear other points of view :)"

* Our ability to visualize and imagine! I imagine we evolved to use this as a way to analyze possible outcomes of a situation, but now we daydream-- we can realistically put ourselves in any scenario or world we want. And my goodness, that is an incredible talent. 

Anyway, these are just the things I've been thinking about today! Feel free to add more in the comments! Have a fantastic day, my fellow optimists <3"
BrightlyInvisible,ENFP,"For anyone who doesn't know, the Liberation Pledge is essentially a pledge where you promise to

1. Live vegan
2. Decline to eat where animals are being eaten (I'm not sure if this only applies to meat, or dairy and other animal products as well)
3. Encourage others to take the pledge

[Here is its website](http://www.liberationpledge.com/)

I've seen a lot of different reactions to it, and my personal opinion as an abolitionist is that it's our responsibility to do what will be best for the animals. That means we have a delicate balance to maintain: on the one hand, we should do whatever we can to raise awareness and encourage others to go vegan. On the other, this pledge could come off as ""cultish"" or give vegans a bad look, so to speak. I think people will be less likely to go vegan if our reputation is a negative one. 

What do you all think? So curious to hear other points of view :)"
BrightlyInvisible,ENFP,"I am someone who really values my dreams and I listen to what my subconscious is trying to tell me. The past six months or so, I've dreamt of spiders almost nightly. They aren't nightmares, but I do get nervous when they get too close to me. In my waking life, I have no fear of spiders either. I like to study them, I pick them up if I'm sure they're benign, I never kill them, and if I find one in my room, I let them stay there. I'm starting to wonder if maybe spiders are my familiar / spirit guide / spirit animal? 

If anyone has a similar experience with creatures visiting them in dreams, I'd love to hear about it and hear your thoughts on the matter :)"

Then he lied to the operator and made sure I got banned. Anyway, I guess none of y'all really care, haha. Ngl, I'm still shaking even though it's been like half an hour. This hit me really hard. I think I might take a break from Minecraft for a little while. Also, I think I'll stop wearing rainbow pins on my jackets. I feel kind of silly saying this but I haven't been able to stop crying, which I think is because Minecraft is both my safe space and my coping mechanism. I feel like such a small thing as losing a Minecraft base + access to a realm shouldn't be hitting me this hard but it is for some reason. Yikes. Wow. I do *not* like homophobia.

Alright, without further ado:

**Section 1. Perceiving vs Judging Functions (What's the Difference?)**

The first thing one need to understand before learning about the cognitive functions is the difference between perceiving and judging functions. Perceiving functions (usually denoted by S or N with a small script e or i, meaning extroverted or introverted: Se, Si, Ne, Ni) are just that- how you perceive (i.e. what you notice) about the world and what you prefer to pay attention to. Note: you aren't making any judgments about what you take in, you are just taking in the information with perceiving functions. With judging functions (usually denoted by T or F: Te, Ti, Fe, Fi), you are making a judgment on information that you take in (in the case of Te/Ti ""is this valid or invalid""; in the case of Fe/Fi ""is this right or wrong""/""is this good or bad""/""do I value this or not""). You usually will hear things like, ""he's a dominant judger"" or ""she's a dominant perceiver"" and usually that is referring to your first or dominant function in your cognitive stack. How can you tell if you're a dominant perceiver or judger by just looking at your letters? Easy:

After a typical MBTI test, you will receive 4 letters that end in either a xxxP or xxxJ. For extroverts (ExxP or ExxJ), it's pretty straightforward: if there is a P at the end, you are a dominant perceiver. If there is a J at the end you are a dominant judger. For introverts (IxxP, IxxJ) it's a little bit more complicated- you want to flip the logic- If you're an introvert and have a P at the end (IxxP) then you are a dominant judger; if you have a J at then end, then you are then you are a dominant perceiver.

Dominant perceivers (notice your first letter- I or E, determines your dominant subscript):

* ESFP, ESTP (dominant Se); ISTJ, ISFJ (dominant Si); ENFP, ENTP (dominant Ne); INTJ, INFJ (dominant Ni)

Dominant judgers (again your first letter determines the subscript of your dominant function):

* ENTJ, ESTJ (dominant Te); ISTP, INTP (dominant Ti); ENFJ, ESFJ (dominant Fe), INFP, ISFP (dominant Fi).

Another pattern we can notice/appreciate is the for perceivers you take the first two letters of their MBTI to get their dominant function (example, \[ES\]FP gives you Se and \[IN\]TJ give yous Ni) while for judgers we take their first and third letter to get their dominant functions (example: \[E\]N\[T\]J gives you Te and \[I\]N\[F\]P gives you Fi). It's nice how it all comes together in a nice little package like that.

**Section 2. What do all these letters mean?! (Explaining the Cognitive Functions)**

As I mentioned earlier, perceiving functions focus on taking new information in. While judging functions makes a judgement on new information. The extrovert (e) and introverted (i) subscripts refer to whether you prefer to focus more on the external world (e) or your internal self (i).

**\*\*\*Important Note about extrovered/external vs introverted/internal functions (aka objective vs subjective functions)**: Sometimes extroverted functions get a bad rep for being ""flighty"" or ""too focused on simplifying things."" I want to note that there is an extreme amount information in the external/physical world. When focusing on yourself and your internal thoughts, experiences, feelings, and sensations, you are dealing with a significantly less amount information, so there is room to dive deep. The experiences, thoughts, and feelings of one person who has lived to 100 will be just a drop in comparison to all physical and abstract data regarding Earth/our environment. It's one of the reasons humans have accepted that a singular person can't know *everything* there is to know about the world in one lifetime- it's not practical or nor feasible, thus people with dominant external functions tend to either simplify things or focus on stimuli within the external world for a brief amount of time. Please keep this in mind while I explain the functions.

**Let's start with the perceiving functions first**:

*Sensing functions (S) tend to focus directly on physical stimuli*:

Se (extroverted sensing) - what you notice about the external world using your 5 traditional senses- touch, sight, taste, hear, and smell. People with dominant Se tend to highly attuned with the external environment and can react to external environmental stimuli very well. Se tends to be very present focused- ""what am I sensing or noticing about the environment *right now.*"" Se uses may also make use of kinesthetic sense, but only for a brief moment in order to react to external stimuli- think reflexes. (This use of kinesthetic sense seem to differ from Si use of kinesthetic sense, which keeps track of that information long-term to compare new information to). <-- If that last sentence doesn't make sense to you, then just skip it- dw about it.

Si (introverted sending) - what you physically notice about yourself internally. Si seems to be linked to kinesthetic sense and sensations to how the environment makes *you* feel (ex. Do I feel hot or cold? Am I sleepy? Hungry?) Si users tend to be highly attuned to their physical internal senses and understand how they are physically feeling in the moment.

* We often hear that Si is related to the past, structure, and memories. This is because Si also keeps track of how you have done things in the past and, more importantly, how those things physically made you *feel*. [Emotions and internal physical sensations are often linked](https://www.pnas.org/content/111/2/646), and Si-users tend to be more attuned than the average person to these physical sensations as well as keeps track of them over time. People with dominant Si tend to (but of course not always) eat the same foods that they liked/make them feel pleasant, shower at the same time they know makes them feel the best afterward, and so on. You can also think of it as dominant Si as a bit of a record keeper that keeps track of how physical stimuli has makes them feel now and has made them feel in the past.

*Intuitive functions (N) tend to make abstract connections between physical stimuli:*

Ne (extroverted intuition) - what abstract connections you notice between two or more pieces of physical information in the external world. An example would be looking at a blue towel and thinking of the beach, because you have associated the color blue with the ocean. Another example would be saying a belt looks like a snake because they are similar in size and shape. Ne tends to associate meaning and abstract connections to physical stimuli.

Ni (introverted intuition) - your own personal underlying abstract statements that attempt to explain and predict the physical world. Ni is where you look for abstract ""truths"" or underlying cause-and-effect relationships (or simply just, underlying relationships) between multiple physical stimuli. ""How are all of these things related?"" and ""What will happen once these physical stimuli are manipulated?"" are what Ni attempts to answer. Ni is your own personal synthesized statements attempting to capture your observations and answer those questions. Similar to Si, Ni is also like a record keeper, that keeps track of your synthesized statements/answers so that you can compare new information to them in the future.

* An example of Ni would be learning concept of gravity on your own by letting go of several objects (a pencil, an eraser, and a ball), and then predicting that if you let go of any object in the air, it will fall to the ground. The Ni synthesized statement ""Any object I let go of will be acted upon by gravity and fall to the ground"" is based directly on your observations, thus Ni is a perceiving function. Note that it answers both questions, ""How are the things (i.e. physical stimuli) I dropped all related"" and ""What will happen next based on my dropping (i.e. manipulation) of those objects?"" Important: Also notice, that the synthesized statement/conclusion does NOT specify what you dropped, just the relationship between them. Ni users tend not to remember the exact external stimuli that led them to their conclusion/underlying statement in the first place.

**Next let's take a look at the judging functions**. Judging functions make a judgement whether new information, typically a conclusion, statement, or action, is valid or invalid (Te or Ti) OR right or wrong (Fe or Fi). These judgements are made based on an external or internal set of standards/criteria, which are largely influenced by the highest-stack perceiving function:

*Thinking functions (T) determine whether a statement is or action valid or invalid. (Side note: See* [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKRH03msgMg) *for a quick overview of deductive vs. inductive reasoning).*

Te (extroverted thinking): determines whether information is valid or invalid based on whether it matches the *heuristics* you use to understand the external world (see [video 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReFqFPJHLhA) and [video 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnEq4ZCs4oM)  and [video 3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l86-VqdvFWU) explaining heuristics). Heuristics are very efficient in nature, as they are used primarily to make quick decisions. Because heuristics are directly based primarily on patterns/repeated information in external world/environment, if there are no patterns or organization in the external world then Te becomes useless. Hence, people with high Te prefer their environment to be organized and structured to some extent.

* A heuristic many of us pick up on when we are young is that people with certification and credibility often give us correct/true information. Hence many high Te users prefer to judge a statement as valid if the statement comes from someone who has a certain credibility (ex. professors, scientists, religious leaders, etc- it depends on who your heuristic tells you who you can trust).
* Some people may get confused between my description of Ni and Te- while Ni can help you create heuristics (observations), only Te can judge whether or not something is valid or invalid based on whether it matches those heuristics.
* Te can be related to inductive reasoning, ""something is valid if it matches the heuristic/repeated pattern I've noticed in the past."" See example below:
   * &#x200B;

1. heuristic - every ripe mango (physical stimuli) I've eaten in my life thus far has tasted good, so most likely I will like all ripe mangoes I eat in the future

* 2) new information- someone says I won't like the ripe mangoes she just bought from the store (w/o explanation)
* 3) Te judgement - the new information is invalid because it does not match my heuristic.

Ti (introverted thinking): determines whether information is valid or invalid based on whether it is *consistent* with previous information you have gathered/determined to be valid. It is based on your own personal conclusions/principles/axioms you have previously determined to be true, rather than a pattern/heuristic you have noticed in the external world that will likely lead you to a true answer (which would be Te).

* Note that I have tried to be careful thus far with using the word ""true."" Just because a person with high Ti has personally decided something to be true (and they have probably put a lot of effort into thinking about and determining whether it is true to them or not), does not mean that the conclusion is *actually* true. For instance, imagine you lived in a secluded area with no cats and from a young age you were told that ""all cats walk on two legs."" Someone even showed you several photo-shopped photos of a cat walking on two legs as proof. Based on these photos, you have personally decided to believe that the statement, ""all cats walk on two legs"" is true. Now, you have added that statement to your personal vault of ""true statements""/critera to judge new information against. And every new statement about the subject will be determined as valid or invalid based on whether if it is consistent with the conclusion ""all cats walk on two legs."" Even if the world's most leading cat researcher came to your secluded village one day and told you that cats actually walked on four legs, it wouldn't be enough to convince you. You would hesitate to believe them unless they had proof because it isn't consistent with a conclusion/principle from your personal vault of ""true statements."" And when/if they do prove your criteria/""true statement"" wrong it will be incredibly frustrating because you will now know that every conclusion you have based off of that statement is now faulty. Hence why high Ti users get incredibly upset when a person they trusted in and convinced them to add a statement to their personal vault of ""true statements"" turns out to have lied to them or given them false information. It's also why high Ti users say Ti is overrated and sometimes joke that Ti is a ""garbage in, garbage out"" function.
* As seen from the example above, Ti can be related to deductive reasoning.

*Feeling functions (F) determine whether something is good or bad/or right or wrong (Side note: here is an article on* [personal values](https://business.tutsplus.com/tutorials/what-are-personal-values--cms-31561) *and one on* [social values](https://studyfinance.com/what-are-social-values/)*).*

Fe (extroverted feeling) - determines whether something is good or bad (or right or wrong) based on social values your external group or community has agreed on. Fe-doms are hyper aware of group dynamics, social values, and rules of their culture/group and will judge whether something is right or wrong based on whether they align with those values. For instance, suppose you have lived your whole life in a society where everyone must clap their hands after drinking water to show thanks and gratitude to the Earth. Also suppose you have observed that this is a gesture that is extremely valued in your society. Suddenly, someone who moves into your town joins you for dinner and doesn't do it. Fe judges that this is not right. You decide to teach the person your group's rules. They tell you they are not interested in learning it. Fe judges this person as bad, and they are no longer invited to your dinner parties.

* People with Te in their stack might create a heuristic here that assume people with high Fe are just sheep following a crowd and could never stand up for what's right if it goes against their society's values. And I'd like to argue against that. As I mentioned before, Fe is HIGHLY aware of group dynamics and values, are attuned to them, and internalize them as their own, so high Fe users are likely to spot contradictions from time to time. For instance, if their society states and values ""people be treated equally"" but also says ""this subset of our society should not be treated equally because of how they were born"" then that is a contradiction that Fe judges as ""not right""/bad and will try to bring attention to that contradiction (most likely in a way that is least likely to harm group harmony, since Fe picks that up as a societal value from young age).
* Fe is associated with social values

Fi (introverted feeling) - determines whether something is good or bad (or right or wrong) based on your own personal set of values. These values are developed over time based on your observations and experiences. Using the personal vault example in the Ti section, Fi is a personal vault of values that you have developed based on your personal interactions with your society. The personal values used by Fi as a criteria are usually, but not always, *related* to (not necessarily based on) previous values you have determined to be right or wrong.

\----

Alright, I've been working on this for 4 hours now and I'm running out of steam here. The last thing I'll say about the judging functions are that Fe/Te (extroverted judgers) are more flexible in nature because they are based on external patterns/values. Whereas Fi/Ti (introverted judgers) are more rigid and stubborn in nature because they are based on internal principles/values.

Hope this helps, and I'll be happy to answer any questions if I can make anything more clear (just maybe give me some time to recharge after all of this haha)."

   * &#x200B;

1. heuristic - every ripe mango (physical stimuli) I've eaten in my life thus far has tasted good, so most likely I will like all ripe mangoes I eat in the future

* 2) new information- someone says I won't like the ripe mangoes she just bought from the store (w/o explanation)
* 3) Te judgement - the new information is invalid because it does not match my heuristic.

Ti (introverted thinking): determines whether information is valid or invalid based on whether it is *consistent* with previous information you have gathered/determined to be valid. It is based on your own personal conclusions/principles/axioms you have previously determined to be true, rather than a pattern/heuristic you have noticed in the external world that will likely lead you to a true answer (which would be Te).

* Note that I have tried to be careful thus far with using the word ""true."" Just because a person with high Ti has personally decided something to be true (and they have probably put a lot of effort into thinking about and determining whether it is true to them or not), does not mean that the conclusion is *actually* true. For instance, imagine you lived in a secluded area with no cats and from a young age you were told that ""all cats walk on two legs."" Someone even showed you several photo-shopped photos of a cat walking on two legs as proof. Based on these photos, you have personally decided to believe that the statement, ""all cats walk on two legs"" is true. Now, you have added that statement to your personal vault of ""true statements""/critera to judge new information against. And every new statement about the subject will be determined as valid or invalid based on whether if it is consistent with the conclusion ""all cats walk on two legs."" Even if the world's most leading cat researcher came to your secluded village one day and told you that cats actually walked on four legs, it wouldn't be enough to convince you. You would hesitate to believe them unless they had proof because it isn't consistent with a conclusion/principle from your personal vault of ""true statements."" And when/if they do prove your criteria/""true statement"" wrong it will be incredibly frustrating because you will now know that every conclusion you have based off of that statement is now faulty. Hence why high Ti users get incredibly upset when a person they trusted in and convinced them to add a statement to their personal vault of ""true statements"" turns out to have lied to them or given them false information. It's also why high Ti users say Ti is overrated and sometimes joke that Ti is a ""garbage in, garbage out"" function.
* As seen from the example above, Ti can be related to deductive reasoning.

*Feeling functions (F) determine whether something is good or bad/or right or wrong (Side note: here is an article on* [personal values](https://business.tutsplus.com/tutorials/what-are-personal-values--cms-31561) *and one on* [social values](https://studyfinance.com/what-are-social-values/)*).*

Fe (extroverted feeling) - determines whether something is good or bad (or right or wrong) based on social values your external group or community has agreed on. Fe-doms are hyper aware of group dynamics, social values, and rules of their culture/group and will judge whether something is right or wrong based on whether they align with those values. For instance, suppose you have lived your whole life in a society where everyone must clap their hands after drinking water to show thanks and gratitude to the Earth. Also suppose you have observed that this is a gesture that is extremely valued in your society. Suddenly, someone who moves into your town joins you for dinner and doesn't do it. Fe judges that this is not right. You decide to teach the person your group's rules. They tell you they are not interested in learning it. Fe judges this person as bad, and they are no longer invited to your dinner parties.

* People with Te in their stack might create a heuristic here that assume people with high Fe are just sheep following a crowd and could never stand up for what's right if it goes against their society's values. And I'd like to argue against that. As I mentioned before, Fe is HIGHLY aware of group dynamics and values, are attuned to them, and internalize them as their own, so high Fe users are likely to spot contradictions from time to time. For instance, if their society states and values ""people be treated equally"" but also says ""this subset of our society should not be treated equally because of how they were born"" then that is a contradiction that Fe judges as ""not right""/bad and will try to bring attention to that contradiction (most likely in a way that is least likely to harm group harmony, since Fe picks that up as a societal value from young age).
* Fe is associated with social values

Fi (introverted feeling) - determines whether something is good or bad (or right or wrong) based on your own personal set of values. These values are developed over time based on your observations and experiences. Using the personal vault example in the Ti section, Fi is a personal vault of values that you have developed based on your personal interactions with your society. The personal values used by Fi as a criteria are usually, but not always, *related* to (not necessarily based on) previous values you have determined to be right or wrong.

Alright, I've been working on this for 4 hours now and I'm running out of steam here. The last thing I'll say about the judging functions are that Fe/Te (extroverted judgers) are more flexible in nature because they are based on external patterns/values. Whereas Fi/Ti (introverted judgers) are more rigid and stubborn in nature because they are based on internal principles/values.

Hope this helps, and I'll be happy to answer any questions if I can make anything more clear (just maybe give me some time to recharge after all of this haha)."

Hellowally,ENFP,"I recently became confident in explaining the cognitive functions, and I wanted to share my findings with anyone who was interested :) Side Note: If you would like to develop your cognitive functions, this [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/ENFP/comments/l98hai/enfp_growth_comprehensive_practical_ways_to/) I created some time ago may be helpful (It's in an ENFP stacking since that's my type, but all 8 functions are there so any type can find it applicable).

Alright, without further ado:

**Section 1. Perceiving vs Judging Functions (What's the Difference?)**

The first thing one need to understand before learning about the cognitive functions is the difference between perceiving and judging functions. Perceiving functions (usually denoted by S or N with a small script e or i, meaning extroverted or introverted: Se, Si, Ne, Ni) are just that- how you perceive (i.e. what you notice) about the world and what you prefer to pay attention to. Note: you aren't making any judgments about what you take in, you are just taking in the information with perceiving functions. With judging functions (usually denoted by T or F: Te, Ti, Fe, Fi), you are making a judgment on information that you take in (in the case of Te/Ti ""is this valid or invalid""; in the case of Fe/Fi ""is this right or wrong""/""is this good or bad""/""do I value this or not""). You usually will hear things like, ""he's a dominant judger"" or ""she's a dominant perceiver"" and usually that is referring to your first or dominant function in your cognitive stack. How can you tell if you're a dominant perceiver or judger by just looking at your letters? Easy:

After a typical MBTI test, you will receive 4 letters that end in either a xxxP or xxxJ. For extroverts (ExxP or ExxJ), it's pretty straightforward: if there is a P at the end, you are a dominant perceiver. If there is a J at the end you are a dominant judger. For introverts (IxxP, IxxJ) it's a little bit more complicated- you want to flip the logic- If you're an introvert and have a P at the end (IxxP) then you are a dominant judger; if you have a J at then end, then you are then you are a dominant perceiver.

Dominant perceivers (notice your first letter- I or E, determines your dominant subscript):

* ESFP, ESTP (dominant Se); ISTJ, ISFJ (dominant Si); ENFP, ENTP (dominant Ne); INTJ, INFJ (dominant Ni)

Dominant judgers (again your first letter determines the subscript of your dominant function):

* ENTJ, ESTJ (dominant Te); ISTP, INTP (dominant Ti); ENFJ, ESFJ (dominant Fe), INFP, ISFP (dominant Fi).

Another pattern we can notice/appreciate is the for perceivers you take the first two letters of their MBTI to get their dominant function (example, \[ES\]FP gives you Se and \[IN\]TJ give yous Ni) while for judgers we take their first and third letter to get their dominant functions (example: \[E\]N\[T\]J gives you Te and \[I\]N\[F\]P gives you Fi). It's nice how it all comes together in a nice little package like that.

**Section 2. What do all these letters mean?! (Explaining the Cognitive Functions)**

As I mentioned earlier, perceiving functions focus on taking new information in. While judging functions makes a judgement on new information. The extrovert (e) and introverted (i) subscripts refer to whether you prefer to focus more on the external world (e) or your internal self (i).

**\*\*\*Important Note about extrovered/external vs introverted/internal functions (aka objective vs subjective functions)**: Sometimes extroverted functions get a bad rep for being ""flighty"" or ""too focused on simplifying things."" I want to note that there is an extreme amount information in the external/physical world. When focusing on yourself and your internal thoughts, experiences, feelings, and sensations, you are dealing with a significantly less amount information, so there is room to dive deep. The experiences, thoughts, and feelings of one person who has lived to 100 will be just a drop in comparison to all physical and abstract data regarding Earth/our environment. It's one of the reasons humans have accepted that a singular person can't know *everything* there is to know about the world in one lifetime- it's not practical or nor feasible, thus people with dominant external functions tend to either simplify things or focus on stimuli within the external world for a brief amount of time. Please keep this in mind while I explain the functions.

**Let's start with the perceiving functions first**:

*Sensing functions (S) tend to focus directly on physical stimuli*:

Se (extroverted sensing) - what you notice about the external world using your 5 traditional senses- touch, sight, taste, hear, and smell. People with dominant Se tend to highly attuned with the external environment and can react to external environmental stimuli very well. Se tends to be very present focused- ""what am I sensing or noticing about the environment *right now.*"" Se uses may also make use of kinesthetic sense, but only for a brief moment in order to react to external stimuli- think reflexes. (This use of kinesthetic sense seem to differ from Si use of kinesthetic sense, which keeps track of that information long-term to compare new information to). <-- If that last sentence doesn't make sense to you, then just skip it- dw about it.

Si (introverted sending) - what you physically notice about yourself internally. Si seems to be linked to kinesthetic sense and sensations to how the environment makes *you* feel (ex. Do I feel hot or cold? Am I sleepy? Hungry?) Si users tend to be highly attuned to their physical internal senses and understand how they are physically feeling in the moment.

* We often hear that Si is related to the past, structure, and memories. This is because Si also keeps track of how you have done things in the past and, more importantly, how those things physically made you *feel*. [Emotions and internal physical sensations are often linked](https://www.pnas.org/content/111/2/646), and Si-users tend to be more attuned than the average person to these physical sensations as well as keeps track of them over time. People with dominant Si tend to (but of course not always) eat the same foods that they liked/make them feel pleasant, shower at the same time they know makes them feel the best afterward, and so on. You can also think of it as dominant Si as a bit of a record keeper that keeps track of how physical stimuli has makes them feel now and has made them feel in the past.

*Intuitive functions (N) tend to make abstract connections between physical stimuli:*

Ne (extroverted intuition) - what abstract connections you notice between two or more pieces of physical information in the external world. An example would be looking at a blue towel and thinking of the beach, because you have associated the color blue with the ocean. Another example would be saying a belt looks like a snake because they are similar in size and shape. Ne tends to associate meaning and abstract connections to physical stimuli.

Ni (introverted intuition) - your own personal underlying abstract statements that attempt to explain and predict the physical world. Ni is where you look for abstract ""truths"" or underlying cause-and-effect relationships (or simply just, underlying relationships) between multiple physical stimuli. ""How are all of these things related?"" and ""What will happen once these physical stimuli are manipulated?"" are what Ni attempts to answer. Ni is your own personal synthesized statements attempting to capture your observations and answer those questions. Similar to Si, Ni is also like a record keeper, that keeps track of your synthesized statements/answers so that you can compare new information to them in the future.

* An example of Ni would be learning concept of gravity on your own by letting go of several objects (a pencil, an eraser, and a ball), and then predicting that if you let go of any object in the air, it will fall to the ground. The Ni synthesized statement ""Any object I let go of will be acted upon by gravity and fall to the ground"" is based directly on your observations, thus Ni is a perceiving function. Note that it answers both questions, ""How are the things (i.e. physical stimuli) I dropped all related"" and ""What will happen next based on my dropping (i.e. manipulation) of those objects?"" Important: Also notice, that the synthesized statement/conclusion does NOT specify what you dropped, just the relationship between them. Ni users tend not to remember the exact external stimuli that led them to their conclusion/underlying statement in the first place.

**Next let's take a look at the judging functions**. Judging functions make a judgement whether new information, typically a conclusion, statement, or action, is valid or invalid (Te or Ti) OR right or wrong (Fe or Fi). These judgements are made based on an external or internal set of standards/criteria, which are largely influenced by the highest-stack perceiving function:

*Thinking functions (T) determine whether a statement is or action valid or invalid. (Side note: See* [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKRH03msgMg) *for a quick overview of deductive vs. inductive reasoning).*

Te (extroverted thinking): determines whether information is valid or invalid based on whether it matches the *heuristics* you use to understand the external world (see [video 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReFqFPJHLhA) and [video 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnEq4ZCs4oM)  and [video 3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l86-VqdvFWU) explaining heuristics). Heuristics are very efficient in nature, as they are used primarily to make quick decisions. Because heuristics are directly based primarily on patterns/repeated information in external world/environment, if there are no patterns or organization in the external world then Te becomes useless. Hence, people with high Te prefer their environment to be organized and structured to some extent.

* A heuristic many of us pick up on when we are young is that people with certification and credibility often give us correct/true information. Hence many high Te users prefer to judge a statement as valid if the statement comes from someone who has a certain credibility (ex. professors, scientists, religious leaders, etc- it depends on who your heuristic tells you who you can trust).
* Some people may get confused between my description of Ni and Te- while Ni can help you create heuristics (observations), only Te can judge whether or not something is valid or invalid based on whether it matches those heuristics.
* Te can be related to inductive reasoning, ""something is valid if it matches the heuristic/repeated pattern I've noticed in the past."" See example below:
   * &#x200B;

1. heuristic - every ripe mango (physical stimuli) I've eaten in my life thus far has tasted good, so most likely I will like all ripe mangoes I eat in the future

* 2) new information- someone says I won't like the ripe mangoes she just bought from the store (w/o explanation)
* 3) Te judgement - the new information is invalid because it does not match my heuristic.

Ti (introverted thinking): determines whether information is valid or invalid based on whether it is *consistent* with previous information you have gathered/determined to be valid. It is based on your own personal conclusions/principles/axioms you have previously determined to be true, rather than a pattern/heuristic you have noticed in the external world that will likely lead you to a true answer (which would be Te).

* Note that I have tried to be careful thus far with using the word ""true."" Just because a person with high Ti has personally decided something to be true (and they have probably put a lot of effort into thinking about and determining whether it is true to them or not), does not mean that the conclusion is *actually* true. For instance, imagine you lived in a secluded area with no cats and from a young age you were told that ""all cats walk on two legs."" Someone even showed you several photo-shopped photos of a cat walking on two legs as proof. Based on these photos, you have personally decided to believe that the statement, ""all cats walk on two legs"" is true.

It's also why high Ti users say Ti is overrated and sometimes joke that Ti is a ""garbage in, garbage out"" function.
* As seen from the example above, Ti can be related to deductive reasoning.

*Feeling functions (F) determine whether something is good or bad/or right or wrong (Side note: here is an article on* [personal values](https://business.tutsplus.com/tutorials/what-are-personal-values--cms-31561) *and one on* [social values](https://studyfinance.com/what-are-social-values/)*).*

Hellowally,ENFP,"Selfie Sunday made this place kinda feel even more like a real community. Although I didn't participate, I looked forward to seeing the selfies of my fellow ENFPs.

However, since the very first day selfies were posted on this sub, there have been a handful of consistent complainers. To accommodate people, mods required flairs for the first time on this sub which I thought was a great decision. That way, people who did not want to see the selfies could filter them out if they wished to do so.

Now the sticks-in-the-mud (I am giving into my frustration at the moment) have tried not necessarily to vent, but to get more people on their side by posting the same posts we have seen from the beginning ""I want to see more discussions"", ""Anyone else tired of selfie sunday"", ""I HATE selfie sunday"", and so on. At the end of the day, the people who posted these either did not know how to filter the tagged selfies out or were just too lazy to. So they kept complaining.

Having a separate selfie sub is not the solution, having a weekly thread for selfies its not the solution. The selfies were a part of this community, and now just as I thought it would, there are significantly less selfies because linking them is cumbersome. I am also concerned about the safety of those who link to their social media, as that gives even more information than just a picture.

Some might try to flip my argument and say, ""well aren't people just too lazy to upload the link""? And to that I say, filtering by flair is done by the click of a button. You also can just choose to ignore the selfies or put Reddit in Classic View on the mobile app. While uploading a photo onto imgur and then linking it to reddit compared to when you could instantly upload it to reddit before is just cumbersome. It discourages people from participating.

You are free to share your complaints of course, but the notion that these complaints just kept on coming seemingly only in order to gain traction and get the mods to act is just aggravating. And the fact that the mods even went further to accommodate these complaints at the expense of everyone else is just unfortunate.

Those complaints are not the same as sticking up for your values or something you believe in, rather it's just about a small annoyance you were already accommodated for and now everyone else is limited/unintentionally discouraged from doing what they wanted (which is unfortunately and ironically against what being an ENFP stands for anyway) :\\

Not going to fight anyone about this in the comments (though of course your free to share your thoughts), just have been thinking about this for the past few days and seeing the significant decrease in selfie posts finally made me want to share."

Alright, without further ado:

**Section 1. Perceiving vs Judging Functions (What's the Difference?)**

The first thing one need to understand before learning about the cognitive functions is the difference between perceiving and judging functions. Perceiving functions (usually denoted by S or N with a small script e or i, meaning extroverted or introverted: Se, Si, Ne, Ni) are just that- how you perceive (i.e. what you notice) about the world and what you prefer to pay attention to. Note: you aren't making any judgments about what you take in, you are just taking in the information with perceiving functions. With judging functions (usually denoted by T or F: Te, Ti, Fe, Fi), you are making a judgment on information that you take in (in the case of Te/Ti ""is this valid or invalid""; in the case of Fe/Fi ""is this right or wrong""/""is this good or bad""/""do I value this or not""). You usually will hear things like, ""he's a dominant judger"" or ""she's a dominant perceiver"" and usually that is referring to your first or dominant function in your cognitive stack. How can you tell if you're a dominant perceiver or judger by just looking at your letters? Easy:

After a typical MBTI test, you will receive 4 letters that end in either a xxxP or xxxJ. For extroverts (ExxP or ExxJ), it's pretty straightforward: if there is a P at the end, you are a dominant perceiver. If there is a J at the end you are a dominant judger. For introverts (IxxP, IxxJ) it's a little bit more complicated- you want to flip the logic- If you're an introvert and have a P at the end (IxxP) then you are a dominant judger; if you have a J at then end, then you are then you are a dominant perceiver.

Dominant perceivers (notice your first letter- I or E, determines your dominant subscript):

* ESFP, ESTP (dominant Se); ISTJ, ISFJ (dominant Si); ENFP, ENTP (dominant Ne); INTJ, INFJ (dominant Ni)

Dominant judgers (again your first letter determines the subscript of your dominant function):

* ENTJ, ESTJ (dominant Te); ISTP, INTP (dominant Ti); ENFJ, ESFJ (dominant Fe), INFP, ISFP (dominant Fi).

Another pattern we can notice/appreciate is the for perceivers you take the first two letters of their MBTI to get their dominant function (example, \[ES\]FP gives you Se and \[IN\]TJ give yous Ni) while for judgers we take their first and third letter to get their dominant functions (example: \[E\]N\[T\]J gives you Te and \[I\]N\[F\]P gives you Fi). It's nice how it all comes together in a nice little package like that.

**Section 2. What do all these letters mean?! (Explaining the Cognitive Functions)**

As I mentioned earlier, perceiving functions focus on taking new information in. While judging functions makes a judgement on new information. The extrovert (e) and introverted (i) subscripts refer to whether you prefer to focus more on the external world (e) or your internal self (i).

**\*\*\*Important Note about extrovered/external vs introverted/internal functions (aka objective vs subjective functions)**: Sometimes extroverted functions get a bad rep for being ""flighty"" or ""too focused on simplifying things."" I want to note that there is an extreme amount information in the external/physical world. When focusing on yourself and your internal thoughts, experiences, feelings, and sensations, you are dealing with a significantly less amount information, so there is room to dive deep. The experiences, thoughts, and feelings of one person who has lived to 100 will be just a drop in comparison to all physical and abstract data regarding Earth/our environment. It's one of the reasons humans have accepted that a singular person can't know *everything* there is to know about the world in one lifetime- it's not practical or nor feasible, thus people with dominant external functions tend to either simplify things or focus on stimuli within the external world for a brief amount of time.

Ni (introverted intuition) - your own personal underlying abstract statements that attempt to explain and predict the physical world. Ni is where you look for abstract ""truths"" or underlying cause-and-effect relationships (or simply just, underlying relationships) between multiple physical stimuli. ""How are all of these things related?"" and ""What will happen once these physical stimuli are manipulated?"" are what Ni attempts to answer. Ni is your own personal synthesized statements attempting to capture your observations and answer those questions. Similar to Si, Ni is also like a record keeper, that keeps track of your synthesized statements/answers so that you can compare new information to them in the future.

* An example of Ni would be learning concept of gravity on your own by letting go of several objects (a pencil, an eraser, and a ball), and then predicting that if you let go of any object in the air, it will fall to the ground. The Ni synthesized statement ""Any object I let go of will be acted upon by gravity and fall to the ground"" is based directly on your observations, thus Ni is a perceiving function. Note that it answers both questions, ""How are the things (i.e. physical stimuli) I dropped all related"" and ""What will happen next based on my dropping (i.e. manipulation) of those objects?"" Important: Also notice, that the synthesized statement/conclusion does NOT specify what you dropped, just the relationship between them. Ni users tend not to remember the exact external stimuli that led them to their conclusion/underlying statement in the first place.

**Next let's take a look at the judging functions**. Judging functions make a judgement whether new information, typically a conclusion, statement, or action, is valid or invalid (Te or Ti) OR right or wrong (Fe or Fi). These judgements are made based on an external or internal set of standards/criteria, which are largely influenced by the highest-stack perceiving function:

*Thinking functions (T) determine whether a statement is or action valid or invalid. (Side note: See* [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKRH03msgMg) *for a quick overview of deductive vs. inductive reasoning).*

Te (extroverted thinking): determines whether information is valid or invalid based on whether it matches the *heuristics* you use to understand the external world (see [video 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReFqFPJHLhA) and [video 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnEq4ZCs4oM)  and [video 3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l86-VqdvFWU) explaining heuristics). Heuristics are very efficient in nature, as they are used primarily to make quick decisions. Because heuristics are directly based primarily on patterns/repeated information in external world/environment, if there are no patterns or organization in the external world then Te becomes useless. Hence, people with high Te prefer their environment to be organized and structured to some extent.

* A heuristic many of us pick up on when we are young is that people with certification and credibility often give us correct/true information. Hence many high Te users prefer to judge a statement as valid if the statement comes from someone who has a certain credibility (ex. professors, scientists, religious leaders, etc- it depends on who your heuristic tells you who you can trust).
* Some people may get confused between my description of Ni and Te- while Ni can help you create heuristics (observations), only Te can judge whether or not something is valid or invalid based on whether it matches those heuristics.
* Te can be related to inductive reasoning, ""something is valid if it matches the heuristic/repeated pattern I've noticed in the past."" See example below:
   * &#x200B;

1. heuristic - every ripe mango (physical stimuli) I've eaten in my life thus far has tasted good, so most likely I will like all ripe mangoes I eat in the future

* 2) new information- someone says I won't like the ripe mangoes she just bought from the store (w/o explanation)
* 3) Te judgement - the new information is invalid because it does not match my heuristic.

Ti (introverted thinking): determines whether information is valid or invalid based on whether it is *consistent* with previous information you have gathered/determined to be valid. It is based on your own personal conclusions/principles/axioms you have previously determined to be true, rather than a pattern/heuristic you have noticed in the external world that will likely lead you to a true answer (which would be Te).

* Note that I have tried to be careful thus far with using the word ""true."" Just because a person with high Ti has personally decided something to be true (and they have probably put a lot of effort into thinking about and determining whether it is true to them or not), does not mean that the conclusion is *actually* true. For instance, imagine you lived in a secluded area with no cats and from a young age you were told that ""all cats walk on two legs."" Someone even showed you several photo-shopped photos of a cat walking on two legs as proof. Based on these photos, you have personally decided to believe that the statement, ""all cats walk on two legs"" is true. Now, you have added that statement to your personal vault of ""true statements""/critera to judge new information against. And every new statement about the subject will be determined as valid or invalid based on whether if it is consistent with the conclusion ""all cats walk on two legs."" Even if the world's most leading cat researcher came to your secluded village one day and told you that cats actually walked on four legs, it wouldn't be enough to convince you. You would hesitate to believe them unless they had proof because it isn't consistent with a conclusion/principle from your personal vault of ""true statements."" And when/if they do prove your criteria/""true statement"" wrong it will be incredibly frustrating because you will now know that every conclusion you have based off of that statement is now faulty. Hence why high Ti users get incredibly upset when a person they trusted in and convinced them to add a statement to their personal vault of ""true statements"" turns out to have lied to them or given them false information. It's also why high Ti users say Ti is overrated and sometimes joke that Ti is a ""garbage in, garbage out"" function.
* As seen from the example above, Ti can be related to deductive reasoning.

*Feeling functions (F) determine whether something is good or bad/or right or wrong (Side note: here is an article on* [personal values](https://business.tutsplus.com/tutorials/what-are-personal-values--cms-31561) *and one on* [social values](https://studyfinance.com/what-are-social-values/)*).*

Fe (extroverted feeling) - determines whether something is good or bad (or right or wrong) based on social values your external group or community has agreed on. Fe-doms are hyper aware of group dynamics, social values, and rules of their culture/group and will judge whether something is right or wrong based on whether they align with those values. For instance, suppose you have lived your whole life in a society where everyone must clap their hands after drinking water to show thanks and gratitude to the Earth. Also suppose you have observed that this is a gesture that is extremely valued in your society. Suddenly, someone who moves into your town joins you for dinner and doesn't do it. Fe judges that this is not right. You decide to teach the person your group's rules. They tell you they are not interested in learning it. Fe judges this person as bad, and they are no longer invited to your dinner parties.

* People with Te in their stack might create a heuristic here that assume people with high Fe are just sheep following a crowd and could never stand up for what's right if it goes against their society's values. And I'd like to argue against that. As I mentioned before, Fe is HIGHLY aware of group dynamics and values, are attuned to them, and internalize them as their own, so high Fe users are likely to spot contradictions from time to time. For instance, if their society states and values ""people be treated equally"" but also says ""this subset of our society should not be treated equally because of how they were born"" then that is a contradiction that Fe judges as ""not right""/bad and will try to bring attention to that contradiction (most likely in a way that is least likely to harm group harmony, since Fe picks that up as a societal value from young age).
* Fe is associated with social values

Fi (introverted feeling) - determines whether something is good or bad (or right or wrong) based on your own personal set of values. These values are developed over time based on your observations and experiences. Using the personal vault example in the Ti section, Fi is a personal vault of values that you have developed based on your personal interactions with your society. The personal values used by Fi as a criteria are usually, but not always, *related* to (not necessarily based on) previous values you have determined to be right or wrong.

\----

Alright, I've been working on this for 4 hours now and I'm running out of steam here. The last thing I'll say about the judging functions are that Fe/Te (extroverted judgers) are more flexible in nature because they are based on external patterns/values. Whereas Fi/Ti (introverted judgers) are more rigid and stubborn in nature because they are based on internal principles/values.

Hope this helps, and I'll be happy to answer any questions if I can make anything more clear (just maybe give me some time to recharge after all of this haha)."
Hellowally,ENFP,"Howdy- ENFP here working on becoming a more stable and responsible person. Just wanted to know some of your life hacks in terms of cleaning, organizing, studying, and keeping track if things. For instance, I recently learned if I wash dishes before I eat (after cooking), it's actually not as bad as if I tried to wash the dishes after (I end up just letting them pile up then). Wondering if you guys have any tips for making tasks/chores/studying a little less stressful and overwhelming then it already is.

Thanks in advance!"
Hellowally,ENFP,"Selfie Sunday made this place kinda feel even more like a real community. Although I didn't participate, I looked forward to seeing the selfies of my fellow ENFPs.

However, since the very first day selfies were posted on this sub, there have been a handful of consistent complainers. To accommodate people, mods required flairs for the first time on this sub which I thought was a great decision. That way, people who did not want to see the selfies could filter them out if they wished to do so.

Now the sticks-in-the-mud (I am giving into my frustration at the moment) have tried not necessarily to vent, but to get more people on their side by posting the same posts we have seen from the beginning ""I want to see more discussions"", ""Anyone else tired of selfie sunday"", ""I HATE selfie sunday"", and so on. At the end of the day, the people who posted these either did not know how to filter the tagged selfies out or were just too lazy to. So they kept complaining.

Having a separate selfie sub is not the solution, having a weekly thread for selfies its not the solution. The selfies were a part of this community, and now just as I thought it would, there are significantly less selfies because linking them is cumbersome. I am also concerned about the safety of those who link to their social media, as that gives even more information than just a picture.

Some might try to flip my argument and say, ""well aren't people just too lazy to upload the link""? And to that I say, filtering by flair is done by the click of a button. You also can just choose to ignore the selfies or put Reddit in Classic View on the mobile app. While uploading a photo onto imgur and then linking it to reddit compared to when you could instantly upload it to reddit before is just cumbersome. It discourages people from participating.

You are free to share your complaints of course, but the notion that these complaints just kept on coming seemingly only in order to gain traction and get the mods to act is just aggravating. And the fact that the mods even went further to accommodate these complaints at the expense of everyone else is just unfortunate.

Those complaints are not the same as sticking up for your values or something you believe in, rather it's just about a small annoyance you were already accommodated for and now everyone else is limited/unintentionally discouraged from doing what they wanted (which is unfortunately and ironically against what being an ENFP stands for anyway) :\\

Not going to fight anyone about this in the comments (though of course your free to share your thoughts), just have been thinking about this for the past few days and seeing the significant decrease in selfie posts finally made me want to share."

I wanted to create it because I know how vague some of the descriptions can be on other sites. Hope you guys find it helpful :) 

[Here's](https://www.reddit.com/r/mbti/comments/obvxce/a_hopefully_clear_explanation_of_the_cognitive/) the post. Would be happy for any feedback or answer any questions you have. I'm off to take a nap now after typing all of that for so long haha."
Hellowally,ENFP,"I recently became confident in explaining the cognitive functions, and I wanted to share my findings with anyone who was interested :) Side Note: If you would like to develop your cognitive functions, this [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/ENFP/comments/l98hai/enfp_growth_comprehensive_practical_ways_to/) I created some time ago may be helpful (It's in an ENFP stacking since that's my type, but all 8 functions are there so any type can find it applicable).

Alright, without further ado:

**Section 1. Perceiving vs Judging Functions (What's the Difference?)**

The first thing one need to understand before learning about the cognitive functions is the difference between perceiving and judging functions. Perceiving functions (usually denoted by S or N with a small script e or i, meaning extroverted or introverted: Se, Si, Ne, Ni) are just that- how you perceive (i.e. what you notice) about the world and what you prefer to pay attention to. Note: you aren't making any judgments about what you take in, you are just taking in the information with perceiving functions. With judging functions (usually denoted by T or F: Te, Ti, Fe, Fi), you are making a judgment on information that you take in (in the case of Te/Ti ""is this valid or invalid""; in the case of Fe/Fi ""is this right or wrong""/""is this good or bad""/""do I value this or not""). You usually will hear things like, ""he's a dominant judger"" or ""she's a dominant perceiver"" and usually that is referring to your first or dominant function in your cognitive stack. How can you tell if you're a dominant perceiver or judger by just looking at your letters? Easy:

After a typical MBTI test, you will receive 4 letters that end in either a xxxP or xxxJ. For extroverts (ExxP or ExxJ), it's pretty straightforward: if there is a P at the end, you are a dominant perceiver. If there is a J at the end you are a dominant judger. For introverts (IxxP, IxxJ) it's a little bit more complicated- you want to flip the logic- If you're an introvert and have a P at the end (IxxP) then you are a dominant judger; if you have a J at then end, then you are then you are a dominant perceiver.

Dominant perceivers (notice your first letter- I or E, determines your dominant subscript):

* ESFP, ESTP (dominant Se); ISTJ, ISFJ (dominant Si); ENFP, ENTP (dominant Ne); INTJ, INFJ (dominant Ni)

Dominant judgers (again your first letter determines the subscript of your dominant function):

* ENTJ, ESTJ (dominant Te); ISTP, INTP (dominant Ti); ENFJ, ESFJ (dominant Fe), INFP, ISFP (dominant Fi).

Another pattern we can notice/appreciate is the for perceivers you take the first two letters of their MBTI to get their dominant function (example, \[ES\]FP gives you Se and \[IN\]TJ give yous Ni) while for judgers we take their first and third letter to get their dominant functions (example: \[E\]N\[T\]J gives you Te and \[I\]N\[F\]P gives you Fi). It's nice how it all comes together in a nice little package like that.

**Section 2. What do all these letters mean?! (Explaining the Cognitive Functions)**

As I mentioned earlier, perceiving functions focus on taking new information in. While judging functions makes a judgement on new information. The extrovert (e) and introverted (i) subscripts refer to whether you prefer to focus more on the external world (e) or your internal self (i).

**\*\*\*Important Note about extrovered/external vs introverted/internal functions (aka objective vs subjective functions)**: Sometimes extroverted functions get a bad rep for being ""flighty"" or ""too focused on simplifying things."" I want to note that there is an extreme amount information in the external/physical world. When focusing on yourself and your internal thoughts, experiences, feelings, and sensations, you are dealing with a significantly less amount information, so there is room to dive deep. The experiences, thoughts, and feelings of one person who has lived to 100 will be just a drop in comparison to all physical and abstract data regarding Earth/our environment. It's one of the reasons humans have accepted that a singular person can't know *everything* there is to know about the world in one lifetime- it's not practical or nor feasible, thus people with dominant external functions tend to either simplify things or focus on stimuli within the external world for a brief amount of time. Please keep this in mind while I explain the functions.

**Let's start with the perceiving functions first**:

*Sensing functions (S) tend to focus directly on physical stimuli*:

Se (extroverted sensing) - what you notice about the external world using your 5 traditional senses- touch, sight, taste, hear, and smell. People with dominant Se tend to highly attuned with the external environment and can react to external environmental stimuli very well. Se tends to be very present focused- ""what am I sensing or noticing about the environment *right now.*"" Se uses may also make use of kinesthetic sense, but only for a brief moment in order to react to external stimuli- think reflexes. (This use of kinesthetic sense seem to differ from Si use of kinesthetic sense, which keeps track of that information long-term to compare new information to). <-- If that last sentence doesn't make sense to you, then just skip it- dw about it.

Si (introverted sending) - what you physically notice about yourself internally. Si seems to be linked to kinesthetic sense and sensations to how the environment makes *you* feel (ex. Do I feel hot or cold? Am I sleepy? Hungry?) Si users tend to be highly attuned to their physical internal senses and understand how they are physically feeling in the moment.

* We often hear that Si is related to the past, structure, and memories. This is because Si also keeps track of how you have done things in the past and, more importantly, how those things physically made you *feel*. [Emotions and internal physical sensations are often linked](https://www.pnas.org/content/111/2/646), and Si-users tend to be more attuned than the average person to these physical sensations as well as keeps track of them over time. People with dominant Si tend to (but of course not always) eat the same foods that they liked/make them feel pleasant, shower at the same time they know makes them feel the best afterward, and so on. You can also think of it as dominant Si as a bit of a record keeper that keeps track of how physical stimuli has makes them feel now and has made them feel in the past.

*Intuitive functions (N) tend to make abstract connections between physical stimuli:*

Ne (extroverted intuition) - what abstract connections you notice between two or more pieces of physical information in the external world. An example would be looking at a blue towel and thinking of the beach, because you have associated the color blue with the ocean. Another example would be saying a belt looks like a snake because they are similar in size and shape. Ne tends to associate meaning and abstract connections to physical stimuli.

Ni (introverted intuition) - your own personal underlying abstract statements that attempt to explain and predict the physical world. Ni is where you look for abstract ""truths"" or underlying cause-and-effect relationships (or simply just, underlying relationships) between multiple physical stimuli. ""How are all of these things related?"" and ""What will happen once these physical stimuli are manipulated?"" are what Ni attempts to answer. Ni is your own personal synthesized statements attempting to capture your observations and answer those questions. Similar to Si, Ni is also like a record keeper, that keeps track of your synthesized statements/answers so that you can compare new information to them in the future.

* An example of Ni would be learning concept of gravity on your own by letting go of several objects (a pencil, an eraser, and a ball), and then predicting that if you let go of any object in the air, it will fall to the ground. The Ni synthesized statement ""Any object I let go of will be acted upon by gravity and fall to the ground"" is based directly on your observations, thus Ni is a perceiving function. Note that it answers both questions, ""How are the things (i.e. physical stimuli) I dropped all related"" and ""What will happen next based on my dropping (i.e. manipulation) of those objects?"" Important: Also notice, that the synthesized statement/conclusion does NOT specify what you dropped, just the relationship between them. Ni users tend not to remember the exact external stimuli that led them to their conclusion/underlying statement in the first place.

**Next let's take a look at the judging functions**. Judging functions make a judgement whether new information, typically a conclusion, statement, or action, is valid or invalid (Te or Ti) OR right or wrong (Fe or Fi). These judgements are made based on an external or internal set of standards/criteria, which are largely influenced by the highest-stack perceiving function:

*Thinking functions (T) determine whether a statement is or action valid or invalid. (Side note: See* [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKRH03msgMg) *for a quick overview of deductive vs. inductive reasoning).*

Te (extroverted thinking): determines whether information is valid or invalid based on whether it matches the *heuristics* you use to understand the external world (see [video 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReFqFPJHLhA) and [video 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnEq4ZCs4oM)  and [video 3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l86-VqdvFWU) explaining heuristics). Heuristics are very efficient in nature, as they are used primarily to make quick decisions. Because heuristics are directly based primarily on patterns/repeated information in external world/environment, if there are no patterns or organization in the external world then Te becomes useless. Hence, people with high Te prefer their environment to be organized and structured to some extent.

* A heuristic many of us pick up on when we are young is that people with certification and credibility often give us correct/true information. Hence many high Te users prefer to judge a statement as valid if the statement comes from someone who has a certain credibility (ex. professors, scientists, religious leaders, etc- it depends on who your heuristic tells you who you can trust).
* Some people may get confused between my description of Ni and Te- while Ni can help you create heuristics (observations), only Te can judge whether or not something is valid or invalid based on whether it matches those heuristics.
* Te can be related to inductive reasoning, ""something is valid if it matches the heuristic/repeated pattern I've noticed in the past."" See example below:
   * &#x200B;

1. heuristic - every ripe mango (physical stimuli) I've eaten in my life thus far has tasted good, so most likely I will like all ripe mangoes I eat in the future

* 2) new information- someone says I won't like the ripe mangoes she just bought from the store (w/o explanation)
* 3) Te judgement - the new information is invalid because it does not match my heuristic.

Ti (introverted thinking): determines whether information is valid or invalid based on whether it is *consistent* with previous information you have gathered/determined to be valid. It is based on your own personal conclusions/principles/axioms you have previously determined to be true, rather than a pattern/heuristic you have noticed in the external world that will likely lead you to a true answer (which would be Te).

* Note that I have tried to be careful thus far with using the word ""true."" Just because a person with high Ti has personally decided something to be true (and they have probably put a lot of effort into thinking about and determining whether it is true to them or not), does not mean that the conclusion is *actually* true. For instance, imagine you lived in a secluded area with no cats and from a young age you were told that ""all cats walk on two legs."" Someone even showed you several photo-shopped photos of a cat walking on two legs as proof. Based on these photos, you have personally decided to believe that the statement, ""all cats walk on two legs"" is true. Now, you have added that statement to your personal vault of ""true statements""/critera to judge new information against. And every new statement about the subject will be determined as valid or invalid based on whether if it is consistent with the conclusion ""all cats walk on two legs."" Even if the world's most leading cat researcher came to your secluded village one day and told you that cats actually walked on four legs, it wouldn't be enough to convince you. You would hesitate to believe them unless they had proof because it isn't consistent with a conclusion/principle from your personal vault of ""true statements."" And when/if they do prove your criteria/""true statement"" wrong it will be incredibly frustrating because you will now know that every conclusion you have based off of that statement is now faulty. Hence why high Ti users get incredibly upset when a person they trusted in and convinced them to add a statement to their personal vault of ""true statements"" turns out to have lied to them or given them false information. It's also why high Ti users say Ti is overrated and sometimes joke that Ti is a ""garbage in, garbage out"" function.
* As seen from the example above, Ti can be related to deductive reasoning.

*Feeling functions (F) determine whether something is good or bad/or right or wrong (Side note: here is an article on* [personal values](https://business.tutsplus.com/tutorials/what-are-personal-values--cms-31561) *and one on* [social values](https://studyfinance.com/what-are-social-values/)*).*

Fe (extroverted feeling) - determines whether something is good or bad (or right or wrong) based on social values your external group or community has agreed on. Fe-doms are hyper aware of group dynamics, social values, and rules of their culture/group and will judge whether something is right or wrong based on whether they align with those values. For instance, suppose you have lived your whole life in a society where everyone must clap their hands after drinking water to show thanks and gratitude to the Earth. Also suppose you have observed that this is a gesture that is extremely valued in your society. Suddenly, someone who moves into your town joins you for dinner and doesn't do it. Fe judges that this is not right. You decide to teach the person your group's rules. They tell you they are not interested in learning it. Fe judges this person as bad, and they are no longer invited to your dinner parties.

* People with Te in their stack might create a heuristic here that assume people with high Fe are just sheep following a crowd and could never stand up for what's right if it goes against their society's values. And I'd like to argue against that. As I mentioned before, Fe is HIGHLY aware of group dynamics and values, are attuned to them, and internalize them as their own, so high Fe users are likely to spot contradictions from time to time. For instance, if their society states and values ""people be treated equally"" but also says ""this subset of our society should not be treated equally because of how they were born"" then that is a contradiction that Fe judges as ""not right""/bad and will try to bring attention to that contradiction (most likely in a way that is least likely to harm group harmony, since Fe picks that up as a societal value from young age).
* Fe is associated with social values

Fi (introverted feeling) - determines whether something is good or bad (or right or wrong) based on your own personal set of values. These values are developed over time based on your observations and experiences. Using the personal vault example in the Ti section, Fi is a personal vault of values that you have developed based on your personal interactions with your society. The personal values used by Fi as a criteria are usually, but not always, *related* to (not necessarily based on) previous values you have determined to be right or wrong.

Hellowally,ENFP,"I feel this character represents the ""darker"" or anxious side of ENFPs so well. I find the way she deals with people and issues so relatable. It's rare that I find a webcomic this realistic in characters so I wanted to share it with you guys. It's a love story between two girls (at least it seems that the story will eventually get there), though so far it focuses on their struggles of dealing with people and communication. I think Joy (protagnist) is an ENFP but I'm unsure (I don't think she's an Fe-dom ExFJ or an introvert despite her coming off that way at first). I think Aerie is an xSTP, though I guess i could also see her as an xSFP too. 

The story is called ""A Joyful Life"" and you can read it [here](https://bato.to/series/86394).

Hope you guys find this as relatable as I did.

[Here's](https://www.reddit.com/r/mbti/comments/obvxce/a_hopefully_clear_explanation_of_the_cognitive/) the post. Would be happy for any feedback or answer any questions you have. I'm off to take a nap now after typing all of that for so long haha."
Hellowally,ENFP,"I recently became confident in explaining the cognitive functions, and I wanted to share my findings with anyone who was interested :) Side Note: If you would like to develop your cognitive functions, this [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/ENFP/comments/l98hai/enfp_growth_comprehensive_practical_ways_to/) I created some time ago may be helpful (It's in an ENFP stacking since that's my type, but all 8 functions are there so any type can find it applicable).

Alright, without further ado:

**Section 1. Perceiving vs Judging Functions (What's the Difference?)**

The first thing one need to understand before learning about the cognitive functions is the difference between perceiving and judging functions. Perceiving functions (usually denoted by S or N with a small script e or i, meaning extroverted or introverted: Se, Si, Ne, Ni) are just that- how you perceive (i.e. what you notice) about the world and what you prefer to pay attention to. Note: you aren't making any judgments about what you take in, you are just taking in the information with perceiving functions. With judging functions (usually denoted by T or F: Te, Ti, Fe, Fi), you are making a judgment on information that you take in (in the case of Te/Ti ""is this valid or invalid""; in the case of Fe/Fi ""is this right or wrong""/""is this good or bad""/""do I value this or not""). You usually will hear things like, ""he's a dominant judger"" or ""she's a dominant perceiver"" and usually that is referring to your first or dominant function in your cognitive stack. How can you tell if you're a dominant perceiver or judger by just looking at your letters? Easy:

After a typical MBTI test, you will receive 4 letters that end in either a xxxP or xxxJ. For extroverts (ExxP or ExxJ), it's pretty straightforward: if there is a P at the end, you are a dominant perceiver. If there is a J at the end you are a dominant judger. For introverts (IxxP, IxxJ) it's a little bit more complicated- you want to flip the logic- If you're an introvert and have a P at the end (IxxP) then you are a dominant judger; if you have a J at then end, then you are then you are a dominant perceiver.

Dominant perceivers (notice your first letter- I or E, determines your dominant subscript):

* ESFP, ESTP (dominant Se); ISTJ, ISFJ (dominant Si); ENFP, ENTP (dominant Ne); INTJ, INFJ (dominant Ni)

Dominant judgers (again your first letter determines the subscript of your dominant function):

* ENTJ, ESTJ (dominant Te); ISTP, INTP (dominant Ti); ENFJ, ESFJ (dominant Fe), INFP, ISFP (dominant Fi).

Another pattern we can notice/appreciate is the for perceivers you take the first two letters of their MBTI to get their dominant function (example, \[ES\]FP gives you Se and \[IN\]TJ give yous Ni) while for judgers we take their first and third letter to get their dominant functions (example: \[E\]N\[T\]J gives you Te and \[I\]N\[F\]P gives you Fi). It's nice how it all comes together in a nice little package like that.

**Section 2. What do all these letters mean?! (Explaining the Cognitive Functions)**

As I mentioned earlier, perceiving functions focus on taking new information in. While judging functions makes a judgement on new information. The extrovert (e) and introverted (i) subscripts refer to whether you prefer to focus more on the external world (e) or your internal self (i).

**\*\*\*Important Note about extrovered/external vs introverted/internal functions (aka objective vs subjective functions)**: Sometimes extroverted functions get a bad rep for being ""flighty"" or ""too focused on simplifying things."" I want to note that there is an extreme amount information in the external/physical world. When focusing on yourself and your internal thoughts, experiences, feelings, and sensations, you are dealing with a significantly less amount information, so there is room to dive deep. The experiences, thoughts, and feelings of one person who has lived to 100 will be just a drop in comparison to all physical and abstract data regarding Earth/our environment. It's one of the reasons humans have accepted that a singular person can't know *everything* there is to know about the world in one lifetime- it's not practical or nor feasible, thus people with dominant external functions tend to either simplify things or focus on stimuli within the external world for a brief amount of time. Please keep this in mind while I explain the functions.

**Let's start with the perceiving functions first**:

*Sensing functions (S) tend to focus directly on physical stimuli*:

Se (extroverted sensing) - what you notice about the external world using your 5 traditional senses- touch, sight, taste, hear, and smell. People with dominant Se tend to highly attuned with the external environment and can react to external environmental stimuli very well. Se tends to be very present focused- ""what am I sensing or noticing about the environment *right now.*"" Se uses may also make use of kinesthetic sense, but only for a brief moment in order to react to external stimuli- think reflexes. (This use of kinesthetic sense seem to differ from Si use of kinesthetic sense, which keeps track of that information long-term to compare new information to). <-- If that last sentence doesn't make sense to you, then just skip it- dw about it.

Si (introverted sending) - what you physically notice about yourself internally. Si seems to be linked to kinesthetic sense and sensations to how the environment makes *you* feel (ex. Do I feel hot or cold? Am I sleepy? Hungry?) Si users tend to be highly attuned to their physical internal senses and understand how they are physically feeling in the moment.

* We often hear that Si is related to the past, structure, and memories. This is because Si also keeps track of how you have done things in the past and, more importantly, how those things physically made you *feel*. [Emotions and internal physical sensations are often linked](https://www.pnas.org/content/111/2/646), and Si-users tend to be more attuned than the average person to these physical sensations as well as keeps track of them over time. People with dominant Si tend to (but of course not always) eat the same foods that they liked/make them feel pleasant, shower at the same time they know makes them feel the best afterward, and so on. You can also think of it as dominant Si as a bit of a record keeper that keeps track of how physical stimuli has makes them feel now and has made them feel in the past.

*Intuitive functions (N) tend to make abstract connections between physical stimuli:*

Ne (extroverted intuition) - what abstract connections you notice between two or more pieces of physical information in the external world. An example would be looking at a blue towel and thinking of the beach, because you have associated the color blue with the ocean. Another example would be saying a belt looks like a snake because they are similar in size and shape. Ne tends to associate meaning and abstract connections to physical stimuli.

Ni (introverted intuition) - your own personal underlying abstract statements that attempt to explain and predict the physical world. Ni is where you look for abstract ""truths"" or underlying cause-and-effect relationships (or simply just, underlying relationships) between multiple physical stimuli. ""How are all of these things related?"" and ""What will happen once these physical stimuli are manipulated?"" are what Ni attempts to answer. Ni is your own personal synthesized statements attempting to capture your observations and answer those questions. Similar to Si, Ni is also like a record keeper, that keeps track of your synthesized statements/answers so that you can compare new information to them in the future.

* An example of Ni would be learning concept of gravity on your own by letting go of several objects (a pencil, an eraser, and a ball), and then predicting that if you let go of any object in the air, it will fall to the ground. The Ni synthesized statement ""Any object I let go of will be acted upon by gravity and fall to the ground"" is based directly on your observations, thus Ni is a perceiving function. Note that it answers both questions, ""How are the things (i.e. physical stimuli) I dropped all related"" and ""What will happen next based on my dropping (i.e. manipulation) of those objects?"" Important: Also notice, that the synthesized statement/conclusion does NOT specify what you dropped, just the relationship between them. Ni users tend not to remember the exact external stimuli that led them to their conclusion/underlying statement in the first place.

**Next let's take a look at the judging functions**. Judging functions make a judgement whether new information, typically a conclusion, statement, or action, is valid or invalid (Te or Ti) OR right or wrong (Fe or Fi). These judgements are made based on an external or internal set of standards/criteria, which are largely influenced by the highest-stack perceiving function:

*Thinking functions (T) determine whether a statement is or action valid or invalid. (Side note: See* [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKRH03msgMg) *for a quick overview of deductive vs. inductive reasoning).*

Te (extroverted thinking): determines whether information is valid or invalid based on whether it matches the *heuristics* you use to understand the external world (see [video 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReFqFPJHLhA) and [video 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnEq4ZCs4oM)  and [video 3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l86-VqdvFWU) explaining heuristics). Heuristics are very efficient in nature, as they are used primarily to make quick decisions. Because heuristics are directly based primarily on patterns/repeated information in external world/environment, if there are no patterns or organization in the external world then Te becomes useless. Hence, people with high Te prefer their environment to be organized and structured to some extent.

* A heuristic many of us pick up on when we are young is that people with certification and credibility often give us correct/true information. Hence many high Te users prefer to judge a statement as valid if the statement comes from someone who has a certain credibility (ex. professors, scientists, religious leaders, etc- it depends on who your heuristic tells you who you can trust).
* Some people may get confused between my description of Ni and Te- while Ni can help you create heuristics (observations), only Te can judge whether or not something is valid or invalid based on whether it matches those heuristics.
* Te can be related to inductive reasoning, ""something is valid if it matches the heuristic/repeated pattern I've noticed in the past."" See example below:
   * &#x200B;

1. heuristic - every ripe mango (physical stimuli) I've eaten in my life thus far has tasted good, so most likely I will like all ripe mangoes I eat in the future

* 2) new information- someone says I won't like the ripe mangoes she just bought from the store (w/o explanation)
* 3) Te judgement - the new information is invalid because it does not match my heuristic.

Ti (introverted thinking): determines whether information is valid or invalid based on whether it is *consistent* with previous information you have gathered/determined to be valid. It is based on your own personal conclusions/principles/axioms you have previously determined to be true, rather than a pattern/heuristic you have noticed in the external world that will likely lead you to a true answer (which would be Te).

* Note that I have tried to be careful thus far with using the word ""true."" Just because a person with high Ti has personally decided something to be true (and they have probably put a lot of effort into thinking about and determining whether it is true to them or not), does not mean that the conclusion is *actually* true. For instance, imagine you lived in a secluded area with no cats and from a young age you were told that ""all cats walk on two legs."" Someone even showed you several photo-shopped photos of a cat walking on two legs as proof. Based on these photos, you have personally decided to believe that the statement, ""all cats walk on two legs"" is true. Now, you have added that statement to your personal vault of ""true statements""/critera to judge new information against. And every new statement about the subject will be determined as valid or invalid based on whether if it is consistent with the conclusion ""all cats walk on two legs."" Even if the world's most leading cat researcher came to your secluded village one day and told you that cats actually walked on four legs, it wouldn't be enough to convince you. You would hesitate to believe them unless they had proof because it isn't consistent with a conclusion/principle from your personal vault of ""true statements."" And when/if they do prove your criteria/""true statement"" wrong it will be incredibly frustrating because you will now know that every conclusion you have based off of that statement is now faulty. Hence why high Ti users get incredibly upset when a person they trusted in and convinced them to add a statement to their personal vault of ""true statements"" turns out to have lied to them or given them false information. It's also why high Ti users say Ti is overrated and sometimes joke that Ti is a ""garbage in, garbage out"" function.
* As seen from the example above, Ti can be related to deductive reasoning.

*Feeling functions (F) determine whether something is good or bad/or right or wrong (Side note: here is an article on* [personal values](https://business.tutsplus.com/tutorials/what-are-personal-values--cms-31561) *and one on* [social values](https://studyfinance.com/what-are-social-values/)*).*

Fe (extroverted feeling) - determines whether something is good or bad (or right or wrong) based on social values your external group or community has agreed on. Fe-doms are hyper aware of group dynamics, social values, and rules of their culture/group and will judge whether something is right or wrong based on whether they align with those values. For instance, suppose you have lived your whole life in a society where everyone must clap their hands after drinking water to show thanks and gratitude to the Earth. Also suppose you have observed that this is a gesture that is extremely valued in your society. Suddenly, someone who moves into your town joins you for dinner and doesn't do it. Fe judges that this is not right. You decide to teach the person your group's rules. They tell you they are not interested in learning it. Fe judges this person as bad, and they are no longer invited to your dinner parties.

* People with Te in their stack might create a heuristic here that assume people with high Fe are just sheep following a crowd and could never stand up for what's right if it goes against their society's values. And I'd like to argue against that. As I mentioned before, Fe is HIGHLY aware of group dynamics and values, are attuned to them, and internalize them as their own, so high Fe users are likely to spot contradictions from time to time. For instance, if their society states and values ""people be treated equally"" but also says ""this subset of our society should not be treated equally because of how they were born"" then that is a contradiction that Fe judges as ""not right""/bad and will try to bring attention to that contradiction (most likely in a way that is least likely to harm group harmony, since Fe picks that up as a societal value from young age).
* Fe is associated with social values

Fi (introverted feeling) - determines whether something is good or bad (or right or wrong) based on your own personal set of values. These values are developed over time based on your observations and experiences. Using the personal vault example in the Ti section, Fi is a personal vault of values that you have developed based on your personal interactions with your society. The personal values used by Fi as a criteria are usually, but not always, *related* to (not necessarily based on) previous values you have determined to be right or wrong.

\----

Alright, I've been working on this for 4 hours now and I'm running out of steam here. The last thing I'll say about the judging functions are that Fe/Te (extroverted judgers) are more flexible in nature because they are based on external patterns/values. Whereas Fi/Ti (introverted judgers) are more rigid and stubborn in nature because they are based on internal principles/values.

Hope this helps, and I'll be happy to answer any questions if I can make anything more clear (just maybe give me some time to recharge after all of this haha)."
Hellowally,ENFP,"Howdy- ENFP here working on becoming a more stable and responsible person. Just wanted to know some of your life hacks in terms of cleaning, organizing, studying, and keeping track if things. For instance, I recently learned if I wash dishes before I eat (after cooking), it's actually not as bad as if I tried to wash the dishes after (I end up just letting them pile up then). Wondering if you guys have any tips for making tasks/chores/studying a little less stressful and overwhelming then it already is.

Thanks in advance!"
Hellowally,ENFP,"Selfie Sunday made this place kinda feel even more like a real community. Although I didn't participate, I looked forward to seeing the selfies of my fellow ENFPs.

However, since the very first day selfies were posted on this sub, there have been a handful of consistent complainers. To accommodate people, mods required flairs for the first time on this sub which I thought was a great decision. That way, people who did not want to see the selfies could filter them out if they wished to do so.

Now the sticks-in-the-mud (I am giving into my frustration at the moment) have tried not necessarily to vent, but to get more people on their side by posting the same posts we have seen from the beginning ""I want to see more discussions"", ""Anyone else tired of selfie sunday"", ""I HATE selfie sunday"", and so on. At the end of the day, the people who posted these either did not know how to filter the tagged selfies out or were just too lazy to. So they kept complaining.

Having a separate selfie sub is not the solution, having a weekly thread for selfies its not the solution. The selfies were a part of this community, and now just as I thought it would, there are significantly less selfies because linking them is cumbersome. I am also concerned about the safety of those who link to their social media, as that gives even more information than just a picture.

Some might try to flip my argument and say, ""well aren't people just too lazy to upload the link""? And to that I say, filtering by flair is done by the click of a button. You also can just choose to ignore the selfies or put Reddit in Classic View on the mobile app. While uploading a photo onto imgur and then linking it to reddit compared to when you could instantly upload it to reddit before is just cumbersome. It discourages people from participating.

You are free to share your complaints of course, but the notion that these complaints just kept on coming seemingly only in order to gain traction and get the mods to act is just aggravating. And the fact that the mods even went further to accommodate these complaints at the expense of everyone else is just unfortunate.

Those complaints are not the same as sticking up for your values or something you believe in, rather it's just about a small annoyance you were already accommodated for and now everyone else is limited/unintentionally discouraged from doing what they wanted (which is unfortunately and ironically against what being an ENFP stands for anyway) :\\

Not going to fight anyone about this in the comments (though of course your free to share your thoughts), just have been thinking about this for the past few days and seeing the significant decrease in selfie posts finally made me want to share."

Hellowally,ENFP,"I feel this character represents the ""darker"" or anxious side of ENFPs so well. I find the way she deals with people and issues so relatable. It's rare that I find a webcomic this realistic in characters so I wanted to share it with you guys. It's a love story between two girls (at least it seems that the story will eventually get there), though so far it focuses on their struggles of dealing with people and communication. I think Joy (protagnist) is an ENFP but I'm unsure (I don't think she's an Fe-dom ExFJ or an introvert despite her coming off that way at first). I think Aerie is an xSTP, though I guess i could also see her as an xSFP too. 

The story is called ""A Joyful Life"" and you can read it [here](https://bato.to/series/86394).

Hope you guys find this as relatable as I did.

Warning: while it's doesn't seem to be explicitly shown, it does mention assault."
Hellowally,ENFP,"Howdy! I've recently been really trying to work on my own Fe, especially when it comes to disagreeing with people and giving feedback. Thus I wanted to ask the amazing Fe-doms for advice. :D Often I get told I'm a bit too direct or I want to give feedback right in the moment when people might not be ready to hear it.

Being and Fi and Te user these are a bit of a struggle for me. The reason I try to give feedback in the moment is because either 1) I feel i'll forget to tell the person later if I don't do it in the moment (or I won't feel I have the energy to do it), 2) if I don't do it in the moment, they won't see what I'm talking about, it will hard for me to give them the example if they ask for it (i.e. they'll ask me for an example and my mind goes blank because I'll remember it happened but not the specifics) or 3) There never seems to be a good time to give feedback. If the person (I'm not talking about a particular person, more just in general) is a good mood, then I'm worried I will spoil their mood. If it's in the moment, they may get upset or might not be ready for it. And doing it when their in a bad mood will only make them angrier and won't be productive.

I want to give feedback because I want to help people grow and because I think the feedback will help them work better with others in the future as well. So I definitely want to give it (to the people I think it will actually be helpful to/if I think they are a good person who wants to grow), but wording it has always been more and more of a challenge for me. Typically how I give feedback now is, ""Hey this is unsolicited advice and I know this might not be your intention/you're a good person, but I think you might come off as arrogant sometimes."" Even if I try to soften it a bit more, you can see how that can get me in trouble.

Additionally in terms of disagreeing with people (especially Ti users), there's a lot I think I can work on, too. I recently saw I video by a ISTP that said something along the lines of ""Don't tell me 'hey I think you're wrong because XYZ' you should tell me 'I see what you're saying. Though from my perspective...'"". This is really difficult for me, because my Fi automatic reaction is saying the second is ""fake"" (when I know it's not necessarily) and that I shouldn't have to change the way I speak just so my point can be taken in more readily. I'm really trying hard to overcome that gut reaction, because I definitely want to work on this. 

Thank you for reading this and I'd appreciate any advice you have."

Alright, without further ado:

**Section 1. Perceiving vs Judging Functions (What's the Difference?)**

The first thing one need to understand before learning about the cognitive functions is the difference between perceiving and judging functions. Perceiving functions (usually denoted by S or N with a small script e or i, meaning extroverted or introverted: Se, Si, Ne, Ni) are just that- how you perceive (i.e. what you notice) about the world and what you prefer to pay attention to. Note: you aren't making any judgments about what you take in, you are just taking in the information with perceiving functions. With judging functions (usually denoted by T or F: Te, Ti, Fe, Fi), you are making a judgment on information that you take in (in the case of Te/Ti ""is this valid or invalid""; in the case of Fe/Fi ""is this right or wrong""/""is this good or bad""/""do I value this or not""). You usually will hear things like, ""he's a dominant judger"" or ""she's a dominant perceiver"" and usually that is referring to your first or dominant function in your cognitive stack. How can you tell if you're a dominant perceiver or judger by just looking at your letters? Easy:

After a typical MBTI test, you will receive 4 letters that end in either a xxxP or xxxJ. For extroverts (ExxP or ExxJ), it's pretty straightforward: if there is a P at the end, you are a dominant perceiver. If there is a J at the end you are a dominant judger. For introverts (IxxP, IxxJ) it's a little bit more complicated- you want to flip the logic- If you're an introvert and have a P at the end (IxxP) then you are a dominant judger; if you have a J at then end, then you are then you are a dominant perceiver.

Dominant perceivers (notice your first letter- I or E, determines your dominant subscript):

* ESFP, ESTP (dominant Se); ISTJ, ISFJ (dominant Si); ENFP, ENTP (dominant Ne); INTJ, INFJ (dominant Ni)

Dominant judgers (again your first letter determines the subscript of your dominant function):

* ENTJ, ESTJ (dominant Te); ISTP, INTP (dominant Ti); ENFJ, ESFJ (dominant Fe), INFP, ISFP (dominant Fi).

Another pattern we can notice/appreciate is the for perceivers you take the first two letters of their MBTI to get their dominant function (example, \[ES\]FP gives you Se and \[IN\]TJ give yous Ni) while for judgers we take their first and third letter to get their dominant functions (example: \[E\]N\[T\]J gives you Te and \[I\]N\[F\]P gives you Fi). It's nice how it all comes together in a nice little package like that.

**Section 2. What do all these letters mean?! (Explaining the Cognitive Functions)**

As I mentioned earlier, perceiving functions focus on taking new information in. While judging functions makes a judgement on new information. The extrovert (e) and introverted (i) subscripts refer to whether you prefer to focus more on the external world (e) or your internal self (i).

**\*\*\*Important Note about extrovered/external vs introverted/internal functions (aka objective vs subjective functions)**: Sometimes extroverted functions get a bad rep for being ""flighty"" or ""too focused on simplifying things."" I want to note that there is an extreme amount information in the external/physical world. When focusing on yourself and your internal thoughts, experiences, feelings, and sensations, you are dealing with a significantly less amount information, so there is room to dive deep. The experiences, thoughts, and feelings of one person who has lived to 100 will be just a drop in comparison to all physical and abstract data regarding Earth/our environment. It's one of the reasons humans have accepted that a singular person can't know *everything* there is to know about the world in one lifetime- it's not practical or nor feasible, thus people with dominant external functions tend to either simplify things or focus on stimuli within the external world for a brief amount of time. Please keep this in mind while I explain the functions.

**Let's start with the perceiving functions first**:

*Sensing functions (S) tend to focus directly on physical stimuli*:

(This use of kinesthetic sense seem to differ from Si use of kinesthetic sense, which keeps track of that information long-term to compare new information to). <-- If that last sentence doesn't make sense to you, then just skip it- dw about it.

Si (introverted sending) - what you physically notice about yourself internally. Si seems to be linked to kinesthetic sense and sensations to how the environment makes *you* feel (ex. Do I feel hot or cold? Am I sleepy? Hungry?) Si users tend to be highly attuned to their physical internal senses and understand how they are physically feeling in the moment.

* We often hear that Si is related to the past, structure, and memories. This is because Si also keeps track of how you have done things in the past and, more importantly, how those things physically made you *feel*. [Emotions and internal physical sensations are often linked](https://www.pnas.org/content/111/2/646), and Si-users tend to be more attuned than the average person to these physical sensations as well as keeps track of them over time. People with dominant Si tend to (but of course not always) eat the same foods that they liked/make them feel pleasant, shower at the same time they know makes them feel the best afterward, and so on. You can also think of it as dominant Si as a bit of a record keeper that keeps track of how physical stimuli has makes them feel now and has made them feel in the past.

*Intuitive functions (N) tend to make abstract connections between physical stimuli:*

Ne (extroverted intuition) - what abstract connections you notice between two or more pieces of physical information in the external world. An example would be looking at a blue towel and thinking of the beach, because you have associated the color blue with the ocean. Another example would be saying a belt looks like a snake because they are similar in size and shape. Ne tends to associate meaning and abstract connections to physical stimuli.

Ni (introverted intuition) - your own personal underlying abstract statements that attempt to explain and predict the physical world. Ni is where you look for abstract ""truths"" or underlying cause-and-effect relationships (or simply just, underlying relationships) between multiple physical stimuli. ""How are all of these things related?"" and ""What will happen once these physical stimuli are manipulated?"" are what Ni attempts to answer. Ni is your own personal synthesized statements attempting to capture your observations and answer those questions. Similar to Si, Ni is also like a record keeper, that keeps track of your synthesized statements/answers so that you can compare new information to them in the future.

* An example of Ni would be learning concept of gravity on your own by letting go of several objects (a pencil, an eraser, and a ball), and then predicting that if you let go of any object in the air, it will fall to the ground. The Ni synthesized statement ""Any object I let go of will be acted upon by gravity and fall to the ground"" is based directly on your observations, thus Ni is a perceiving function. Note that it answers both questions, ""How are the things (i.e. physical stimuli) I dropped all related"" and ""What will happen next based on my dropping (i.e. manipulation) of those objects?"" Important: Also notice, that the synthesized statement/conclusion does NOT specify what you dropped, just the relationship between them. Ni users tend not to remember the exact external stimuli that led them to their conclusion/underlying statement in the first place.

**Next let's take a look at the judging functions**. Judging functions make a judgement whether new information, typically a conclusion, statement, or action, is valid or invalid (Te or Ti) OR right or wrong (Fe or Fi). These judgements are made based on an external or internal set of standards/criteria, which are largely influenced by the highest-stack perceiving function:

*Thinking functions (T) determine whether a statement is or action valid or invalid. (Side note: See* [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKRH03msgMg) *for a quick overview of deductive vs. inductive reasoning).*

Te (extroverted thinking): determines whether information is valid or invalid based on whether it matches the *heuristics* you use to understand the external world (see [video 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReFqFPJHLhA) and [video 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnEq4ZCs4oM)  and [video 3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l86-VqdvFWU) explaining heuristics). Heuristics are very efficient in nature, as they are used primarily to make quick decisions. Because heuristics are directly based primarily on patterns/repeated information in external world/environment, if there are no patterns or organization in the external world then Te becomes useless. Hence, people with high Te prefer their environment to be organized and structured to some extent.

* A heuristic many of us pick up on when we are young is that people with certification and credibility often give us correct/true information. Hence many high Te users prefer to judge a statement as valid if the statement comes from someone who has a certain credibility (ex. professors, scientists, religious leaders, etc- it depends on who your heuristic tells you who you can trust).
* Some people may get confused between my description of Ni and Te- while Ni can help you create heuristics (observations), only Te can judge whether or not something is valid or invalid based on whether it matches those heuristics.
* Te can be related to inductive reasoning, ""something is valid if it matches the heuristic/repeated pattern I've noticed in the past."" See example below:
   * &#x200B;

1. heuristic - every ripe mango (physical stimuli) I've eaten in my life thus far has tasted good, so most likely I will like all ripe mangoes I eat in the future

* 2) new information- someone says I won't like the ripe mangoes she just bought from the store (w/o explanation)
* 3) Te judgement - the new information is invalid because it does not match my heuristic.

Ti (introverted thinking): determines whether information is valid or invalid based on whether it is *consistent* with previous information you have gathered/determined to be valid. It is based on your own personal conclusions/principles/axioms you have previously determined to be true, rather than a pattern/heuristic you have noticed in the external world that will likely lead you to a true answer (which would be Te).

* Note that I have tried to be careful thus far with using the word ""true."" Just because a person with high Ti has personally decided something to be true (and they have probably put a lot of effort into thinking about and determining whether it is true to them or not), does not mean that the conclusion is *actually* true. For instance, imagine you lived in a secluded area with no cats and from a young age you were told that ""all cats walk on two legs."" Someone even showed you several photo-shopped photos of a cat walking on two legs as proof. Based on these photos, you have personally decided to believe that the statement, ""all cats walk on two legs"" is true. Now, you have added that statement to your personal vault of ""true statements""/critera to judge new information against. And every new statement about the subject will be determined as valid or invalid based on whether if it is consistent with the conclusion ""all cats walk on two legs."" Even if the world's most leading cat researcher came to your secluded village one day and told you that cats actually walked on four legs, it wouldn't be enough to convince you. You would hesitate to believe them unless they had proof because it isn't consistent with a conclusion/principle from your personal vault of ""true statements."" And when/if they do prove your criteria/""true statement"" wrong it will be incredibly frustrating because you will now know that every conclusion you have based off of that statement is now faulty. Hence why high Ti users get incredibly upset when a person they trusted in and convinced them to add a statement to their personal vault of ""true statements"" turns out to have lied to them or given them false information. It's also why high Ti users say Ti is overrated and sometimes joke that Ti is a ""garbage in, garbage out"" function.
* As seen from the example above, Ti can be related to deductive reasoning.

*Feeling functions (F) determine whether something is good or bad/or right or wrong (Side note: here is an article on* [personal values](https://business.tutsplus.com/tutorials/what-are-personal-values--cms-31561) *and one on* [social values](https://studyfinance.com/what-are-social-values/)*).*

Fe (extroverted feeling) - determines whether something is good or bad (or right or wrong) based on social values your external group or community has agreed on. Fe-doms are hyper aware of group dynamics, social values, and rules of their culture/group and will judge whether something is right or wrong based on whether they align with those values. For instance, suppose you have lived your whole life in a society where everyone must clap their hands after drinking water to show thanks and gratitude to the Earth. Also suppose you have observed that this is a gesture that is extremely valued in your society. Suddenly, someone who moves into your town joins you for dinner and doesn't do it. Fe judges that this is not right. You decide to teach the person your group's rules. They tell you they are not interested in learning it. Fe judges this person as bad, and they are no longer invited to your dinner parties.

* People with Te in their stack might create a heuristic here that assume people with high Fe are just sheep following a crowd and could never stand up for what's right if it goes against their society's values. And I'd like to argue against that. As I mentioned before, Fe is HIGHLY aware of group dynamics and values, are attuned to them, and internalize them as their own, so high Fe users are likely to spot contradictions from time to time. For instance, if their society states and values ""people be treated equally"" but also says ""this subset of our society should not be treated equally because of how they were born"" then that is a contradiction that Fe judges as ""not right""/bad and will try to bring attention to that contradiction (most likely in a way that is least likely to harm group harmony, since Fe picks that up as a societal value from young age).
* Fe is associated with social values

Fi (introverted feeling) - determines whether something is good or bad (or right or wrong) based on your own personal set of values. These values are developed over time based on your observations and experiences. Using the personal vault example in the Ti section, Fi is a personal vault of values that you have developed based on your personal interactions with your society. The personal values used by Fi as a criteria are usually, but not always, *related* to (not necessarily based on) previous values you have determined to be right or wrong.

Alright, I've been working on this for 4 hours now and I'm running out of steam here. The last thing I'll say about the judging functions are that Fe/Te (extroverted judgers) are more flexible in nature because they are based on external patterns/values. Whereas Fi/Ti (introverted judgers) are more rigid and stubborn in nature because they are based on internal principles/values.

Hope this helps, and I'll be happy to answer any questions if I can make anything more clear (just maybe give me some time to recharge after all of this haha)."
Hellowally,ENFP,"Howdy- ENFP here working on becoming a more stable and responsible person. Just wanted to know some of your life hacks in terms of cleaning, organizing, studying, and keeping track if things. For instance, I recently learned if I wash dishes before I eat (after cooking), it's actually not as bad as if I tried to wash the dishes after (I end up just letting them pile up then). Wondering if you guys have any tips for making tasks/chores/studying a little less stressful and overwhelming then it already is.

Thanks in advance!"
Hellowally,ENFP,"Selfie Sunday made this place kinda feel even more like a real community. Although I didn't participate, I looked forward to seeing the selfies of my fellow ENFPs.

However, since the very first day selfies were posted on this sub, there have been a handful of consistent complainers. To accommodate people, mods required flairs for the first time on this sub which I thought was a great decision. That way, people who did not want to see the selfies could filter them out if they wished to do so.

Now the sticks-in-the-mud (I am giving into my frustration at the moment) have tried not necessarily to vent, but to get more people on their side by posting the same posts we have seen from the beginning ""I want to see more discussions"", ""Anyone else tired of selfie sunday"", ""I HATE selfie sunday"", and so on. At the end of the day, the people who posted these either did not know how to filter the tagged selfies out or were just too lazy to. So they kept complaining.

Having a separate selfie sub is not the solution, having a weekly thread for selfies its not the solution. The selfies were a part of this community, and now just as I thought it would, there are significantly less selfies because linking them is cumbersome. I am also concerned about the safety of those who link to their social media, as that gives even more information than just a picture.

Some might try to flip my argument and say, ""well aren't people just too lazy to upload the link""? And to that I say, filtering by flair is done by the click of a button. You also can just choose to ignore the selfies or put Reddit in Classic View on the mobile app. While uploading a photo onto imgur and then linking it to reddit compared to when you could instantly upload it to reddit before is just cumbersome. It discourages people from participating.

You are free to share your complaints of course, but the notion that these complaints just kept on coming seemingly only in order to gain traction and get the mods to act is just aggravating. And the fact that the mods even went further to accommodate these complaints at the expense of everyone else is just unfortunate.

Those complaints are not the same as sticking up for your values or something you believe in, rather it's just about a small annoyance you were already accommodated for and now everyone else is limited/unintentionally discouraged from doing what they wanted (which is unfortunately and ironically against what being an ENFP stands for anyway) :\\

Not going to fight anyone about this in the comments (though of course your free to share your thoughts), just have been thinking about this for the past few days and seeing the significant decrease in selfie posts finally made me want to share."

Hellowally,ENFP,"I feel this character represents the ""darker"" or anxious side of ENFPs so well. I find the way she deals with people and issues so relatable. It's rare that I find a webcomic this realistic in characters so I wanted to share it with you guys. It's a love story between two girls (at least it seems that the story will eventually get there), though so far it focuses on their struggles of dealing with people and communication. I think Joy (protagnist) is an ENFP but I'm unsure (I don't think she's an Fe-dom ExFJ or an introvert despite her coming off that way at first). I think Aerie is an xSTP, though I guess i could also see her as an xSFP too. 

The story is called ""A Joyful Life"" and you can read it [here](https://bato.to/series/86394).

Hope you guys find this as relatable as I did.

Warning: while it's doesn't seem to be explicitly shown, it does mention assault."
Hellowally,ENFP,"Howdy! I've recently been really trying to work on my own Fe, especially when it comes to disagreeing with people and giving feedback. Thus I wanted to ask the amazing Fe-doms for advice. :D Often I get told I'm a bit too direct or I want to give feedback right in the moment when people might not be ready to hear it.

Being and Fi and Te user these are a bit of a struggle for me. The reason I try to give feedback in the moment is because either 1) I feel i'll forget to tell the person later if I don't do it in the moment (or I won't feel I have the energy to do it), 2) if I don't do it in the moment, they won't see what I'm talking about, it will hard for me to give them the example if they ask for it (i.e. they'll ask me for an example and my mind goes blank because I'll remember it happened but not the specifics) or 3) There never seems to be a good time to give feedback. If the person (I'm not talking about a particular person, more just in general) is a good mood, then I'm worried I will spoil their mood. If it's in the moment, they may get upset or might not be ready for it. And doing it when their in a bad mood will only make them angrier and won't be productive.

I want to give feedback because I want to help people grow and because I think the feedback will help them work better with others in the future as well. So I definitely want to give it (to the people I think it will actually be helpful to/if I think they are a good person who wants to grow), but wording it has always been more and more of a challenge for me. Typically how I give feedback now is, ""Hey this is unsolicited advice and I know this might not be your intention/you're a good person, but I think you might come off as arrogant sometimes."" Even if I try to soften it a bit more, you can see how that can get me in trouble.

Additionally in terms of disagreeing with people (especially Ti users), there's a lot I think I can work on, too. I recently saw I video by a ISTP that said something along the lines of ""Don't tell me 'hey I think you're wrong because XYZ' you should tell me 'I see what you're saying. Though from my perspective...'"". This is really difficult for me, because my Fi automatic reaction is saying the second is ""fake"" (when I know it's not necessarily) and that I shouldn't have to change the way I speak just so my point can be taken in more readily. I'm really trying hard to overcome that gut reaction, because I definitely want to work on this. 

Thank you for reading this and I'd appreciate any advice you have."

Hellowally,ENFP,"Howdy- just spent like 4 hours working on a new post on the MBTI subreddit explaining each cognitive function as clearly and as simply as I could and wanted to share it with you guys. I wanted to create it because I know how vague some of the descriptions can be on other sites. Hope you guys find it helpful :) 

[Here's](https://www.reddit.com/r/mbti/comments/obvxce/a_hopefully_clear_explanation_of_the_cognitive/) the post. Would be happy for any feedback or answer any questions you have. I'm off to take a nap now after typing all of that for so long haha."
Hellowally,ENFP,"I recently became confident in explaining the cognitive functions, and I wanted to share my findings with anyone who was interested :) Side Note: If you would like to develop your cognitive functions, this [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/ENFP/comments/l98hai/enfp_growth_comprehensive_practical_ways_to/) I created some time ago may be helpful (It's in an ENFP stacking since that's my type, but all 8 functions are there so any type can find it applicable).

Alright, without further ado:

**Section 1. Perceiving vs Judging Functions (What's the Difference?)**

The first thing one need to understand before learning about the cognitive functions is the difference between perceiving and judging functions. Perceiving functions (usually denoted by S or N with a small script e or i, meaning extroverted or introverted: Se, Si, Ne, Ni) are just that- how you perceive (i.e. what you notice) about the world and what you prefer to pay attention to. Note: you aren't making any judgments about what you take in, you are just taking in the information with perceiving functions. With judging functions (usually denoted by T or F: Te, Ti, Fe, Fi), you are making a judgment on information that you take in (in the case of Te/Ti ""is this valid or invalid""; in the case of Fe/Fi ""is this right or wrong""/""is this good or bad""/""do I value this or not""). You usually will hear things like, ""he's a dominant judger"" or ""she's a dominant perceiver"" and usually that is referring to your first or dominant function in your cognitive stack. How can you tell if you're a dominant perceiver or judger by just looking at your letters? Easy:

After a typical MBTI test, you will receive 4 letters that end in either a xxxP or xxxJ. For extroverts (ExxP or ExxJ), it's pretty straightforward: if there is a P at the end, you are a dominant perceiver. If there is a J at the end you are a dominant judger. For introverts (IxxP, IxxJ) it's a little bit more complicated- you want to flip the logic- If you're an introvert and have a P at the end (IxxP) then you are a dominant judger; if you have a J at then end, then you are then you are a dominant perceiver.

Dominant perceivers (notice your first letter- I or E, determines your dominant subscript):

* ESFP, ESTP (dominant Se); ISTJ, ISFJ (dominant Si); ENFP, ENTP (dominant Ne); INTJ, INFJ (dominant Ni)

Dominant judgers (again your first letter determines the subscript of your dominant function):

* ENTJ, ESTJ (dominant Te); ISTP, INTP (dominant Ti); ENFJ, ESFJ (dominant Fe), INFP, ISFP (dominant Fi).

Another pattern we can notice/appreciate is the for perceivers you take the first two letters of their MBTI to get their dominant function (example, \[ES\]FP gives you Se and \[IN\]TJ give yous Ni) while for judgers we take their first and third letter to get their dominant functions (example: \[E\]N\[T\]J gives you Te and \[I\]N\[F\]P gives you Fi). It's nice how it all comes together in a nice little package like that.

**Section 2. What do all these letters mean?! (Explaining the Cognitive Functions)**

As I mentioned earlier, perceiving functions focus on taking new information in. While judging functions makes a judgement on new information. The extrovert (e) and introverted (i) subscripts refer to whether you prefer to focus more on the external world (e) or your internal self (i).

**\*\*\*Important Note about extrovered/external vs introverted/internal functions (aka objective vs subjective functions)**: Sometimes extroverted functions get a bad rep for being ""flighty"" or ""too focused on simplifying things."" I want to note that there is an extreme amount information in the external/physical world. When focusing on yourself and your internal thoughts, experiences, feelings, and sensations, you are dealing with a significantly less amount information, so there is room to dive deep. The experiences, thoughts, and feelings of one person who has lived to 100 will be just a drop in comparison to all physical and abstract data regarding Earth/our environment. It's one of the reasons humans have accepted that a singular person can't know *everything* there is to know about the world in one lifetime- it's not practical or nor feasible, thus people with dominant external functions tend to either simplify things or focus on stimuli within the external world for a brief amount of time. Please keep this in mind while I explain the functions.

**Let's start with the perceiving functions first**:

*Sensing functions (S) tend to focus directly on physical stimuli*:

Se (extroverted sensing) - what you notice about the external world using your 5 traditional senses- touch, sight, taste, hear, and smell. People with dominant Se tend to highly attuned with the external environment and can react to external environmental stimuli very well. Se tends to be very present focused- ""what am I sensing or noticing about the environment *right now.*"" Se uses may also make use of kinesthetic sense, but only for a brief moment in order to react to external stimuli- think reflexes. (This use of kinesthetic sense seem to differ from Si use of kinesthetic sense, which keeps track of that information long-term to compare new information to). <-- If that last sentence doesn't make sense to you, then just skip it- dw about it.

Si (introverted sending) - what you physically notice about yourself internally. Si seems to be linked to kinesthetic sense and sensations to how the environment makes *you* feel (ex. Do I feel hot or cold? Am I sleepy? Hungry?) Si users tend to be highly attuned to their physical internal senses and understand how they are physically feeling in the moment.

* We often hear that Si is related to the past, structure, and memories. This is because Si also keeps track of how you have done things in the past and, more importantly, how those things physically made you *feel*. [Emotions and internal physical sensations are often linked](https://www.pnas.org/content/111/2/646), and Si-users tend to be more attuned than the average person to these physical sensations as well as keeps track of them over time. People with dominant Si tend to (but of course not always) eat the same foods that they liked/make them feel pleasant, shower at the same time they know makes them feel the best afterward, and so on. You can also think of it as dominant Si as a bit of a record keeper that keeps track of how physical stimuli has makes them feel now and has made them feel in the past.

*Intuitive functions (N) tend to make abstract connections between physical stimuli:*

Ne (extroverted intuition) - what abstract connections you notice between two or more pieces of physical information in the external world. An example would be looking at a blue towel and thinking of the beach, because you have associated the color blue with the ocean. Another example would be saying a belt looks like a snake because they are similar in size and shape. Ne tends to associate meaning and abstract connections to physical stimuli.

Ni (introverted intuition) - your own personal underlying abstract statements that attempt to explain and predict the physical world. Ni is where you look for abstract ""truths"" or underlying cause-and-effect relationships (or simply just, underlying relationships) between multiple physical stimuli. ""How are all of these things related?"" and ""What will happen once these physical stimuli are manipulated?"" are what Ni attempts to answer. Ni is your own personal synthesized statements attempting to capture your observations and answer those questions. Similar to Si, Ni is also like a record keeper, that keeps track of your synthesized statements/answers so that you can compare new information to them in the future.

* An example of Ni would be learning concept of gravity on your own by letting go of several objects (a pencil, an eraser, and a ball), and then predicting that if you let go of any object in the air, it will fall to the ground. The Ni synthesized statement ""Any object I let go of will be acted upon by gravity and fall to the ground"" is based directly on your observations, thus Ni is a perceiving function. Note that it answers both questions, ""How are the things (i.e. physical stimuli) I dropped all related"" and ""What will happen next based on my dropping (i.e. manipulation) of those objects?"" Important: Also notice, that the synthesized statement/conclusion does NOT specify what you dropped, just the relationship between them. Ni users tend not to remember the exact external stimuli that led them to their conclusion/underlying statement in the first place.

**Next let's take a look at the judging functions**. Judging functions make a judgement whether new information, typically a conclusion, statement, or action, is valid or invalid (Te or Ti) OR right or wrong (Fe or Fi). These judgements are made based on an external or internal set of standards/criteria, which are largely influenced by the highest-stack perceiving function:

*Thinking functions (T) determine whether a statement is or action valid or invalid. (Side note: See* [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKRH03msgMg) *for a quick overview of deductive vs. inductive reasoning).*

Te (extroverted thinking): determines whether information is valid or invalid based on whether it matches the *heuristics* you use to understand the external world (see [video 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReFqFPJHLhA) and [video 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnEq4ZCs4oM)  and [video 3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l86-VqdvFWU) explaining heuristics). Heuristics are very efficient in nature, as they are used primarily to make quick decisions. Because heuristics are directly based primarily on patterns/repeated information in external world/environment, if there are no patterns or organization in the external world then Te becomes useless. Hence, people with high Te prefer their environment to be organized and structured to some extent.

* A heuristic many of us pick up on when we are young is that people with certification and credibility often give us correct/true information. Hence many high Te users prefer to judge a statement as valid if the statement comes from someone who has a certain credibility (ex. professors, scientists, religious leaders, etc- it depends on who your heuristic tells you who you can trust).
* Some people may get confused between my description of Ni and Te- while Ni can help you create heuristics (observations), only Te can judge whether or not something is valid or invalid based on whether it matches those heuristics.
* Te can be related to inductive reasoning, ""something is valid if it matches the heuristic/repeated pattern I've noticed in the past."" See example below:
   * &#x200B;

1. heuristic - every ripe mango (physical stimuli) I've eaten in my life thus far has tasted good, so most likely I will like all ripe mangoes I eat in the future

* 2) new information- someone says I won't like the ripe mangoes she just bought from the store (w/o explanation)
* 3) Te judgement - the new information is invalid because it does not match my heuristic.

Ti (introverted thinking): determines whether information is valid or invalid based on whether it is *consistent* with previous information you have gathered/determined to be valid. It is based on your own personal conclusions/principles/axioms you have previously determined to be true, rather than a pattern/heuristic you have noticed in the external world that will likely lead you to a true answer (which would be Te).

* Note that I have tried to be careful thus far with using the word ""true."" Just because a person with high Ti has personally decided something to be true (and they have probably put a lot of effort into thinking about and determining whether it is true to them or not), does not mean that the conclusion is *actually* true. For instance, imagine you lived in a secluded area with no cats and from a young age you were told that ""all cats walk on two legs."" Someone even showed you several photo-shopped photos of a cat walking on two legs as proof. Based on these photos, you have personally decided to believe that the statement, ""all cats walk on two legs"" is true. Now, you have added that statement to your personal vault of ""true statements""/critera to judge new information against. And every new statement about the subject will be determined as valid or invalid based on whether if it is consistent with the conclusion ""all cats walk on two legs."" Even if the world's most leading cat researcher came to your secluded village one day and told you that cats actually walked on four legs, it wouldn't be enough to convince you. You would hesitate to believe them unless they had proof because it isn't consistent with a conclusion/principle from your personal vault of ""true statements."" And when/if they do prove your criteria/""true statement"" wrong it will be incredibly frustrating because you will now know that every conclusion you have based off of that statement is now faulty. Hence why high Ti users get incredibly upset when a person they trusted in and convinced them to add a statement to their personal vault of ""true statements"" turns out to have lied to them or given them false information. It's also why high Ti users say Ti is overrated and sometimes joke that Ti is a ""garbage in, garbage out"" function.
* As seen from the example above, Ti can be related to deductive reasoning.

*Feeling functions (F) determine whether something is good or bad/or right or wrong (Side note: here is an article on* [personal values](https://business.tutsplus.com/tutorials/what-are-personal-values--cms-31561) *and one on* [social values](https://studyfinance.com/what-are-social-values/)*).*

Fe (extroverted feeling) - determines whether something is good or bad (or right or wrong) based on social values your external group or community has agreed on. Fe-doms are hyper aware of group dynamics, social values, and rules of their culture/group and will judge whether something is right or wrong based on whether they align with those values. For instance, suppose you have lived your whole life in a society where everyone must clap their hands after drinking water to show thanks and gratitude to the Earth. Also suppose you have observed that this is a gesture that is extremely valued in your society. Suddenly, someone who moves into your town joins you for dinner and doesn't do it. Fe judges that this is not right. You decide to teach the person your group's rules. They tell you they are not interested in learning it. Fe judges this person as bad, and they are no longer invited to your dinner parties.

* People with Te in their stack might create a heuristic here that assume people with high Fe are just sheep following a crowd and could never stand up for what's right if it goes against their society's values. And I'd like to argue against that. As I mentioned before, Fe is HIGHLY aware of group dynamics and values, are attuned to them, and internalize them as their own, so high Fe users are likely to spot contradictions from time to time. For instance, if their society states and values ""people be treated equally"" but also says ""this subset of our society should not be treated equally because of how they were born"" then that is a contradiction that Fe judges as ""not right""/bad and will try to bring attention to that contradiction (most likely in a way that is least likely to harm group harmony, since Fe picks that up as a societal value from young age).
* Fe is associated with social values

Fi (introverted feeling) - determines whether something is good or bad (or right or wrong) based on your own personal set of values. These values are developed over time based on your observations and experiences. Using the personal vault example in the Ti section, Fi is a personal vault of values that you have developed based on your personal interactions with your society. The personal values used by Fi as a criteria are usually, but not always, *related* to (not necessarily based on) previous values you have determined to be right or wrong.

Alright, I've been working on this for 4 hours now and I'm running out of steam here. The last thing I'll say about the judging functions are that Fe/Te (extroverted judgers) are more flexible in nature because they are based on external patterns/values. Whereas Fi/Ti (introverted judgers) are more rigid and stubborn in nature because they are based on internal principles/values.

Hope this helps, and I'll be happy to answer any questions if I can make anything more clear (just maybe give me some time to recharge after all of this haha)."

Hellowally,ENFP,"Selfie Sunday made this place kinda feel even more like a real community. Although I didn't participate, I looked forward to seeing the selfies of my fellow ENFPs.

However, since the very first day selfies were posted on this sub, there have been a handful of consistent complainers. To accommodate people, mods required flairs for the first time on this sub which I thought was a great decision. That way, people who did not want to see the selfies could filter them out if they wished to do so.

Now the sticks-in-the-mud (I am giving into my frustration at the moment) have tried not necessarily to vent, but to get more people on their side by posting the same posts we have seen from the beginning ""I want to see more discussions"", ""Anyone else tired of selfie sunday"", ""I HATE selfie sunday"", and so on. At the end of the day, the people who posted these either did not know how to filter the tagged selfies out or were just too lazy to. So they kept complaining.

Having a separate selfie sub is not the solution, having a weekly thread for selfies its not the solution. The selfies were a part of this community, and now just as I thought it would, there are significantly less selfies because linking them is cumbersome. I am also concerned about the safety of those who link to their social media, as that gives even more information than just a picture.

Some might try to flip my argument and say, ""well aren't people just too lazy to upload the link""? And to that I say, filtering by flair is done by the click of a button. You also can just choose to ignore the selfies or put Reddit in Classic View on the mobile app. While uploading a photo onto imgur and then linking it to reddit compared to when you could instantly upload it to reddit before is just cumbersome. It discourages people from participating.

You are free to share your complaints of course, but the notion that these complaints just kept on coming seemingly only in order to gain traction and get the mods to act is just aggravating. And the fact that the mods even went further to accommodate these complaints at the expense of everyone else is just unfortunate.

Those complaints are not the same as sticking up for your values or something you believe in, rather it's just about a small annoyance you were already accommodated for and now everyone else is limited/unintentionally discouraged from doing what they wanted (which is unfortunately and ironically against what being an ENFP stands for anyway) :\\

Not going to fight anyone about this in the comments (though of course your free to share your thoughts), just have been thinking about this for the past few days and seeing the significant decrease in selfie posts finally made me want to share."

Hellowally,ENFP,"I feel this character represents the ""darker"" or anxious side of ENFPs so well. I find the way she deals with people and issues so relatable. It's rare that I find a webcomic this realistic in characters so I wanted to share it with you guys. It's a love story between two girls (at least it seems that the story will eventually get there), though so far it focuses on their struggles of dealing with people and communication. I think Joy (protagnist) is an ENFP but I'm unsure (I don't think she's an Fe-dom ExFJ or an introvert despite her coming off that way at first). I think Aerie is an xSTP, though I guess i could also see her as an xSFP too. 

The story is called ""A Joyful Life"" and you can read it [here](https://bato.to/series/86394).

Hope you guys find this as relatable as I did.

Warning: while it's doesn't seem to be explicitly shown, it does mention assault."
Hellowally,ENFP,"Howdy! I've recently been really trying to work on my own Fe, especially when it comes to disagreeing with people and giving feedback. Thus I wanted to ask the amazing Fe-doms for advice. :D Often I get told I'm a bit too direct or I want to give feedback right in the moment when people might not be ready to hear it.

Being and Fi and Te user these are a bit of a struggle for me. The reason I try to give feedback in the moment is because either 1) I feel i'll forget to tell the person later if I don't do it in the moment (or I won't feel I have the energy to do it), 2) if I don't do it in the moment, they won't see what I'm talking about, it will hard for me to give them the example if they ask for it (i.e. they'll ask me for an example and my mind goes blank because I'll remember it happened but not the specifics) or 3) There never seems to be a good time to give feedback. If the person (I'm not talking about a particular person, more just in general) is a good mood, then I'm worried I will spoil their mood. If it's in the moment, they may get upset or might not be ready for it. And doing it when their in a bad mood will only make them angrier and won't be productive.

I want to give feedback because I want to help people grow and because I think the feedback will help them work better with others in the future as well. So I definitely want to give it (to the people I think it will actually be helpful to/if I think they are a good person who wants to grow), but wording it has always been more and more of a challenge for me. Typically how I give feedback now is, ""Hey this is unsolicited advice and I know this might not be your intention/you're a good person, but I think you might come off as arrogant sometimes."" Even if I try to soften it a bit more, you can see how that can get me in trouble.

Additionally in terms of disagreeing with people (especially Ti users), there's a lot I think I can work on, too. I recently saw I video by a ISTP that said something along the lines of ""Don't tell me 'hey I think you're wrong because XYZ' you should tell me 'I see what you're saying. Though from my perspective...'"". This is really difficult for me, because my Fi automatic reaction is saying the second is ""fake"" (when I know it's not necessarily) and that I shouldn't have to change the way I speak just so my point can be taken in more readily. I'm really trying hard to overcome that gut reaction, because I definitely want to work on this. 

Thank you for reading this and I'd appreciate any advice you have."

Hellowally,ENFP,"So I've been watching this old-school anime called Daa Daa Daa! and it's got the most xNFPs I have ever seen in a show all at once. There's at least 3 ENFPs (but could be up to 5) and at least 1 (but probably 2 INFPs). The show revolves around a girl (main character, ENFP) and a boy (ISTP, and probably the only grounding character the show) taking care of an alien baby that got sucked into a worm hole that led it to earth one day, after the girl's parent suddenly told her their going to leave for a bit to pursue their dream job of being astronauts at NASA so she has to stay with the boy and his family.

It's honestly a really cute show that you don't have to binge watch since it's focused on day-to-day life, but I thought you all might enjoy it. I kind feel like this show would be a nightmare for any non-xNFP, but most xNFPs might find it cute and endearing.

Other characters in the show include:

* an ESFJ
* a 3 year old ENTJ
* at least two ENFJs
* maybe an ESFP
* an INFx with a very hyperactive imagination.

and a bunch of other characters that add to the wackiness and cuteness of this show. The ISTP also has pretty good/developed inferior Fe imo.

Anyway just wanted to share that with you all. I haven't finished it yet, but there's like 77 eps. It's a really nice pick-me-up if you're having a cruddy day. Hope you enjoy it if you decide to check it out!"

leafynefi,ENFP,"There are lots of thorough subtype descriptions readily available for types 2, 4, 7 and 8 ENFPs, likely because they are amongst the most common subtypes for ENFPs. Unfortunately for me, there's not a whole lot of information on type 3 ENFPs (and even less on the specific wings: 3w2 and 3w4). Though I find some aspects of the general ENFP descriptions relatable, I also find many Te dom/aux type descriptions relatable too in some ways and have been told many times I seem more like a \_\_TJ than ENFP. Further, I've known a lot of other ENFPs in my life (mostly 2s and 7s) who are noticeably different from me and who seem to fit the ENFP descriptions more than I do.

Is anyone able to provide a semi thorough analysis of an ENFP 3w4: perhaps what we are like cognitively, how we differ from other ENFP subtypes, what we need to be healthy, etc.? Would be awesome, as it's hard to find (just like we are apparently!)

Side note: do not know what flair to select for this lol."

leafynefi,ENFP,"With my experience and understanding (please do correct me if I’m wrong) Si is essentially an inner world of sensory-loaded past experiences and factual information based on or taken from those experiences. For example, I can find myself replaying vividly detailed moments of past experiences in my head like a movie and basically feel it as if it’s happening again. Since it’s inferior for me, I’m not 100% sure that I understand it so, like I said, please correct me if I am wrong!!

Anyway, considering the fact that every person of every personality type has memories and the ability to recall past experiences just made me kind of curious as to how Se users/non Si-users experience reflecting on the past and on memories and how they might experience it differently than Si users do.

leafynefi,ENFP,"I am a female Type 3 ENFP living in a *verrrrry* Si-dominant house, with my ISFJ mother, INFP sister and INFP father. As a Type 3, I also have a more developed tertiary extraverted thinking--so as you can imagine, it is incredibly hard for me to have patience for some of the bad habit bs that cycles in this house. My parents are all-round comfort level, routine people and, although my INFP sister might also crave more change and growth, she seems to be a lot more comfortable with Si since she has that tertiary. I am very dominant in the house (sometimes even domineering) and very eager to improve things (systems, routines, etc.) and my parents get threatened by that and it's just difficult because I am only ever pushing for things that I *know* will benefit everyone in the long-run.

I also just feel very limited in this type of environment to develop personal growth because I am constantly surrounded by them talking about and doing the same exact things and to me, feels very monotonous and repetitive and stagnant. As an ENFP, it is very draining and it often makes lose my inspiration for like everything. I become different and lose the little ENFP light inside; or it just gets dimmer and then I start caring about stupid, small shit that I would never have cared about before and stop focusing on things that excite me and propel me forward--or those things just stop having that effect on me (in other words, I adapt to the seemingly never-changing lifestyle habits of my parents and family and it brings out the worst side of me that isn't really me). 

I will add that I love them very, very much--and they are much better people than this might make them sound and they love me too; but it's just not the easiest living so closely to people who are so entirely, fundamentally different than me. So my question for you guys is...how can I make this situation better for myself? How can I re-inspire myself about life and stay inspired living in this environment? I meditate and practice affirmations and all of that stuff, but it is still hard. Maybe I just need to start distancing myself from them more. I'd still love to hear what you think. 

Thanks for reading :)"

I am very dominant in the house (sometimes even domineering) and very eager to improve things (systems, routines, etc.) and my parents get threatened by that and it's just difficult because I am only ever pushing for things that I *know* will benefit everyone in the long-run.

I also just feel very limited in this type of environment to develop personal growth because I am constantly surrounded by them talking about and doing the same exact things and to me, feels very monotonous and repetitive and stagnant. As an ENFP, it is very draining and it often makes lose my inspiration for like everything. I become different and lose the little ENFP light inside; or it just gets dimmer and then I start caring about stupid, small shit that I would never have cared about before and stop focusing on things that excite me and propel me forward--or those things just stop having that effect on me (in other words, I adapt to the seemingly never-changing lifestyle habits of my parents and family and it brings out the worst side of me that isn't really me). 

I will add that I love them very, very much--and they are much better people than this might make them sound and they love me too; but it's just not the easiest living so closely to people who are so entirely, fundamentally different than me. So my question for you guys is...how can I make this situation better for myself? How can I re-inspire myself about life and stay inspired living in this environment? I meditate and practice affirmations and all of that stuff, but it is still hard. Maybe I just need to start distancing myself from them more. I'd still love to hear what you think. 

Thanks for reading :)"
leafynefi,ENFP,"I am struggling with how to phrase this right now lol but does anyone know what I mean by like silent Fi communication? Obviously we Fi types are self-reflective and deal with emotions internally and silently but I feel like we can also communicate sort of telepathically that way.

Just like how Fe types are good at communicating their feelings with each other out loud and in the physical world, I theorize that Fi types often communicate emotionally with each other silently and internally. Or maybe that’s just me and my Fi friends lol. Let me know!!!"

Lassinportland,ENFP,"I (27F) started seeing an old friend (27M) on a romantic level recently and I noticed that things he said, or did, made me feel a genuine type of appreciation and caring that I'd never experienced in past relationships. For context, I've been in several relationships and the last one was long term. 

Diving right into it: 

When I get passionate in conversation, he listens, then hours later he'll repeat what I'd said to him sometimes with questions to further explore my thoughts, proving that he was present and interested in ME (all caps to emphasize me the human being)

I told him a story about a sexist experience of mine, and he listened, didn't suggest what I could've done or should've done, and made me feel supported. (Id always felt uncomfortable with myself that I had to confront someone - like i was the bad guy because I wasn't complying to the feminine image I was raised to standardize)

We were having a silly conversation and I said I can be very dumb sometimes, and his immediate response was ""you're actually very smart"". I never realized that none of my ex's ever told me that, and my mind was always something I'd wanted to be seen for.

I got teary-eyed about not being able to see my best friend anymore (she was moving away), and he became sad with me. I was so used to guys being more of a boulder to lean on that didn't become sad with me if that makes sense. Seeing him feel my emotions with me made me sooo comfortable.

This was a revelation to me to have these small experiences and wanted to share that people like him exist. I'm not sure where our relationship will head as we live in different cities, but I can already see it's something to treasure..."

westwoo,INFP,"There's this stereotypical representation of ENTJs as wealthy CEOs or ambitious millionaires, though obviously the vast majority of ENTJs can't be significantly wealthier than the average based on all data about incomes of MBTI types that we have.

But similarly stereotypical ENTJ goals and aspirations don't make sense for a person of about an average income and wealth. They would lead to feelings of unfulfillment if they were actually true, and ENTJs aren't really known for being more prone to depression or sadness than other types.

Meaning, there has to be much more to this, and perhaps a lot more other types and younger ENTJs can learn about what really drives you...."

magical-chihuahua,ENFP,"I’m prepping to teach a youth theatre summer camp next week. I haven’t done this in four years so I’m feeling rusty (even though I taught acting and directed plays for 9+ years, including running a program at a private school). 

I sent in my bio and headshot and then just saw today that the music director’s bio was much more formal than mine (mine was short and playful because that’s how I roll). She has so much training, experience, and accolades that it kind of deflated me. I didn’t major in theatre, it was just something I’ve done on a community level for fun. My degrees are in other things and so my inner critic has been dumping on me with: you don’t have real credentials, they should find someone with a musical theatre degree, who do you think you are. You know, the usual crap. 

(The funny thing is I would never think this about someone else. My very favorite choreographer to work with never even went to college and has also only done community/youth theatre.)

At any rate, I feel like imposter syndrome is magnified by my ENFP personality. I am infinitely harder on myself then anyone else. At the risk of overthinking this, do ya’ll feel like this also applies to you or am I just assuming it does because it feels very ENFPish?"

I get really passionate about what makes a person unique and interesting. Whether that be their hobbies or hair colour. (Classic ENFP writer)

I like writing down those characteristics as a foundation for future characters in my stories.

I know professionals suggest something along these lines, as it helps to create original characters. But it still feels creepy.

What I do is write down every interesting characteristic of someone. But never anything personal. It mainly consists of hobbies. What makes it feel creepy is the analysis, as if I was stalking that person I know. In reality, an example would be a guy I briefly dated. I would write down that he likes songs with meaningful lyrics, and researching cults. Including paragraphs of details, as a result of my overwriting nature.

As I mentioned previously, I never write down anything personal, just the outer layer of their character. The layer that everyone would know about, by either looking at this person or becoming acquainted.

I don't have a budget, so I'm willing to save up for a good quality, expensive machine."
mysticdragonsage,ENFP,"People just aren't original. I always get the same dumb questions all of the time. People used to ask me ""plants have feelings, so why do you eat them?"" Those people don't actually care about plants, if they did, they would stop eating them. They just want to annoy me, or make me question my diet."
mysticdragonsage,ENFP,"My grandpa took me, my sister and cousin to a vegan festival. My grandpa and me didn't tell the others that everything was vegan. They ate a lot of good food that they wouldn't have if they knew it was vegan. 

I heard that once there was some event, everyone wanted to get meat pizzas. A vegetarian suggested to have all vegetarian food. Everyone strongly opposed that, making that person feel left out. 

Its dumb how a meat eater would eat vegetables all the time with meat, but if there's no meat they refuse to eat it. They're annoyed at the lack of meat even though they like vegetables, considering they eat them with meat all the time."
mysticdragonsage,ENFP,"I've had it. I'm far too indecisive, therefore I'll go to netflix. But not watch anything. You can't just have every movie on your platform and expect people to decide what to watch. We need people to decide that for us!

The quiz would be designed to ask you questions about your personality and mood, then give you results of a movie or TV show based on your answers. 

There also needs a randomise button. You press that button and it gives you a random movie or TV show to watch. 

Please netflix I'm desperate."

I get really passionate about what makes a person unique and interesting. Whether that be their hobbies or hair colour. (Classic ENFP writer)

I like writing down those characteristics as a foundation for future characters in my stories.

I know professionals suggest something along these lines, as it helps to create original characters. But it still feels creepy.

What I do is write down every interesting characteristic of someone. But never anything personal. It mainly consists of hobbies. What makes it feel creepy is the analysis, as if I was stalking that person I know. In reality, an example would be a guy I briefly dated. I would write down that he likes songs with meaningful lyrics, and researching cults. Including paragraphs of details, as a result of my overwriting nature.

As I mentioned previously, I never write down anything personal, just the outer layer of their character. The layer that everyone would know about, by either looking at this person or becoming acquainted.

mysticdragonsage,ENFP,"I really hope this is allowed, and people read this because I'm pretty proud of it. You end up questioning the truth in the end. The requirements for the competition was that it had to be set in a school and under 500 words. 

\~

Three hours ago, you were caught in an accident. According to our school nurse, you're diagnosed with amnesia. 

You should have been kicked out in our first year of university, but all the professors adored your magnetic nature.

The day we first met still lingers around my mind, even today. I walked past you one night in the library. You tripped and cried. The tears a symptom of your stress. Back then I was naïve. I helped you up as you ranted about your unfinished schoolwork.

You wore the mask of an angel, only to hide the demon you really are.

It took me took years to realize you intended to trip right in front of me, flooding me with your empty tears. It was already too late when I suggested I finish your schoolwork for you. 

I’m no idiot, the doubt gleaming from your eyes right now is too blinding that it almost makes me laugh. 

I wanted to be you. You were all of my insecurities that you held like trophies. I started to doubt you in our second year. Students were dropping out like flies. But it was as if their identities were deleted from society. The truth wasn’t as nice as that. 

All of these students had one trait in common. You.

It was too suspicious to ignore, so I investigated. You befriended all of these students to manipulate. It was terrifying how you created a cult of your victims. You were never behind in your studies, you just wanted to burn your follower's lives to ashes. When they lost their usefulness, you forced them to drop out. And killed them. 

You knew all along about my investigation. You wanted me to feel terror and hope. I woke up in the middle of the night in our third year. The police broke into my dorm room, telling me I was under arrest for the murder of Aiden Bursley. No one would believe me when my room was painted red, dripping from the body hanging like a chandelier. 

You framed me and had me locked up in jail! You knew it would ruin my chances of success! You even made me doubt if I really was the killer.

Fortunately, I was able to find students who you couldn’t fool. When they learned your secrets, we strategized an accident that would give you amnesia. This plan was already in motion when I was ruled guilty.

I notice the fear in your eyes, you still doubt me? Do you know how long it took me to escape and change my identity? TEN YEARS! I visit you daily, telling you the same story over and over again, forcing you to live a life of the pain you deserve!

Oh dear I did it again didn’t I? I just can’t not mention your age. Well, I might as well tell you the truth, it’s not like you’ll remember tomorrow anyway.

These events happened three decades ago."

I love both the 16:9 aspect ratio and old and new content, it irks me that I can't crop shows like Futurama on Hulu but I love how on PLEX not only can I crop older shows to fit the modern ratio, but it stays that way (unlike other platforms that make you crop it every time).

notanewbiedude,ENFP,"IMHO, it needs talk shows that focus on sports that they air. Not like NASCAR: Race Hub, but something like Undisputed or First Things First that talks more about things they actually air than sports you're more likely to find on TNT and ESPN. Right now whenever they have their talk show, it just feels like a glorified commercial for the other channels.

They also need to move some of their FOX stuff to FS1. That alone will exponentially raise the caliber of their live programming.

Lastly, they need to make a show where there's a segment where they respond to social media posts. This will incite trends online as well as making viewers feel like they're a part of the show too.

One of the issues I find with FS1 is a lack of football and basketball. When it's college season, they're fine, but there are few NFL or NBA games on FS1, if any. There isn't too much to be done about this, it seems, but they should lean into other popular sports that a channel like ESPN would take for granted, like soccer. If they hype it up, soccer can actually be a ratings winner for them IMHO."
