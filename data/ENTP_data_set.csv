MavenFallon,ENTP,"As an ENTP, I believe the nickname for my personality is a very superficial and even pretty presumptive. I'd rather it be a much more accurate and descriptive name than the debater. I came up with a few good ideas for alternative names for the ENTP:

The Innovator: Because ENTPs are good at and have a reputation for coming up with and introducing new ideas, methods, and perspectives.

The Trckster: I know it may sound kinda bad but here me out, after looking at the qualities of a trickster (at least in storytelling) I realized it greatly resembles the ENTP. ENTPs and tricksters are both very clever but have a hard time actually using that cleverness; they both are typically mischevious; they are both able to adjust to different situations with ease; both are charismatic (if I do say so myself); both struggle focusing on the task at hand; and both are good at deceiving. I honestly and personally think Trickster is the best nickname for the ENTP.

The Theorist: ENTPs constantly want to come up with new ideas and look at things from every perspective possible. The are very inquisitive and have the natural abilities to answer their own questions (when given the right information).

The Brainstormer: For the same reasons as ""Theorist"" and ""Innovator""

The Improviser: Due to their Ne, ENTPs are able to quickly come up with possibilities and imagine them in action. Then, with their Ti, decide which one is the best. They can use this to come up with solutions swiftly to nearly any problem you throw at them (though their solutions don't typically work out or end up being accurate) whichmakes ENTPs great at improv.

The Smart Child: I think you know what I mean hereüòÜ

MavenFallon,ENTP,"So I really like to make music and am really hoping that one day I'll be able to make a successful career out of it. Right now I'm making a song I think you might like; I'm not finished with it yet but I have released a teaser for it. Hope you'll like it and that one day you'll be able to use it in your own videos.

curiousxntpwoman,ENTP,"I'm tired of having to employ the ""secretly distrustful polite but distant"" schtick that I put up. I employ it because of previous trauma surrounding this sort of thing, where I made assumptions about the actual closeness or positivity of our interactions that turned out to just not be true with DISASTROUS results (this can trigger the hell out of us poor ENTPs with our vulnerable Fi).

How do I deal with this better without feeling psychologically utterly unsafe?  It makes me feel extremely vulnerable and unsafe to be put in a situation where someone seems disproportionately friendly for their actual level of care/closeness/etc. to me because it appears to me that the true nature of our relationship is being obscured for the ENFJ's benefit.  I'd like to sabotage my interactions with ENFJs of the good and healthy variety less frequently while avoiding a level of trust that is either too excessive or insufficient and delivering more than half of the control of the encounter to the ENFJ."
curiousxntpwoman,ENTP,"I‚Äôm an ILE with a Fi PoLR problem.  Specifically, I have difficulties telling how other people REALLY feel about me, and it‚Äôs made me into a person who keeps others at a distance to an extent that has shot me in the ass and made me miserable.

This has made me underestimate others‚Äô positive feelings (it doesn‚Äôt make me underestimate others‚Äô negative feelings anymore, though it used to - I overcompensate by being too cynical, however) and sabotage potential connections, has absolutely hamstrung me in the dating world, and makes me into a lonely mess who‚Äôs quite good at charming others superficially but feels she has very few actual close bonds.

How do I actually get around this and elicit cues out of others that I need to assess how they REALLY feel, particularly in socially appropriate ways, particularly if they‚Äôre not necessarily close enough that I can have an intimate conversation with them just yet?"
curiousxntpwoman,ENTP,"intp: my partners in ~~crime~~ getting stoned and binge-watching terrible shit on youtube. even if i'm pretty damn good at math, you're better at it.

entp: when i think of you, i think of three things: the 'me and the boys' meme, all of the nerd arguments you and i clog up our group chats with, and ADHD.

entj: i am in awe of your executive functioning, but you manage to not terrify me as much as estjs do.  you are the person i would be if i had more energy and the system didn't suck to the point that i stopped giving much of a fuck about working in it and instead decided to tell it to go fuck itself, imma make my own system with gigolos and blow.

intj: at your best, you are chill smart hermits. at your worst, i cannot even.

enfp: i love you, you are a quirky fun person, but dear lord try to find at least some kind of direction in life and yes you can actually operationalize and make sense out of some aspects of human emotion and identity and individuality, it's not all just ""i had this feeling!  i like this thing just because i do!"" there are underlying reasons for things and you can make sense of them and it doesn't make that feeling or value or whatever any less \*yours\*.  i do not know how to introverted feeling.

infp: at your best, you are A Marshmallow Who Should Be Protected.  at your worst, i cannot even.  i have the same criticism for you as i do for enfp, but Turned Up to 11 with More Hermiting.

enfj: i see your carefully curated and extremely active social media feed and your go-gettingness and i'm like, yo how the hell do you have the energy for that.  you make damn great mentors though.  you also have rainbows of charisma coming out your asses to the extent it kind of unnerves me and i envy you somewhat.  i can never tell how much it's just you being generally friendly and charismatic and how much it's you appreciating me specifically, pls elaborate.

infj: bless you, you sociable hermits, be less subtle and say more about yourself so i can actually understand you the way you want everybody to. also get out of the house once in a while, be adventurous every so often, and take the stick out of your butt a little more and get a little more comfortable with benign chaos.  you are wonderful. love, your roommate.

istp: i don't think i know any of you.

estp: i am you but the nerdy version. if you are a fictional character, you are usually among my favorites.  at your best, you are fun and funny as shit.  at your worst, dear god keep away from me

esfj/estj: i studiously avoid.  i feel smothered just by looking at you.

isfj/istj: your idea of fun makes me sad

esfp: DRAAAAAAAAAAMAAAAAAA

isfp: draaaaaaaaamaaaaaaaa

curiousxntpwoman,ENTP,"This is informed by my trauma history, but does anyone else feel almost instinctively on edge around heart center types because of their image consciousness, and do we tend to be 5s, 6s, and 8s?  The underlying logic in my head usually goes ‚Äúif they‚Äôre going so far as to curate their image like that, what flaws are they hiding that are so objectionable that they won‚Äôt let us see them?‚Äù

Also, what‚Äôs going on from the type 2, 3, or 4 end when they encounter someone who reacts negatively to their image concern?"

curiousxntpwoman,ENTP,"My mother was a classic deeply unhealthy 2w3 ESFJ.  It is chiefly through her actions that I have been molded into an 8w7.  She was, unsurprisingly, terrifyingly controlling and infantilizing, extremely manipulative, physically abusive sometimes, excessive in her emotional expression, and chock full of vulnerable narcissism.  She gave me crippling issues with low confidence, low self-esteem, impostor syndrome, insecurity about my competence, shame and humiliation from being infantilized, insecurity about my social skills, an EXTREME fear of losing my autonomy, a near-crippling insecurity in my own ability to wield control and a consequent tendency to experience dissociative freeze responses a lot more than I should in the face of conflict, fear of vulnerability, slowness to trust, and fears surrounding intimacy that it has taken me a long time to recover from with the help of therapy, and though I have healed much of this I am still working to heal.

I cut her and my father off three years ago for the sake of my well-being.  This, I am aware, probably traumatized the absolute shit out of her (particularly because she is a 2), but I don't give a shit - she traumatized the absolute shit out of me growing up and stole so much from me, and if she had been healthier she wouldn't have acted in a way that necessitated I do this.

How does one heal from wounds inflicted by an unhealthy 2w3 whom you have no intention of reconciling with? Input from 2s (especially 2w3s) would be especially helpful here."

BrainsOut_EU,ENTP,"Just figured out where it might be coming from - turns out 6th Street is the most famous street in Austin TX. On one hand it's one the most fun to be at, as there's a lot of bars and partying going on and on the other hand it's one of the most dangerous ones - so... it FITS PERFECTLY! \^\_\^ The cowboys, the partying, the violence...

BrainsOut_EU,ENTP,"Hi, I'm an ENTP with some pretty good social skills judging on my day to day... Through reason, empathy, being able to see another persons' motivation, interest, finding common ground and showing respect and understandin to their emotions I can get my point across and, as long as I'm right, convince the other person of practically anything. But with xNFJs... Oh God...- How can I do this? You're pretty much immovable to me... My experience so far is that you hardly have any willingess to let go of your original point of view, friendly or logical arguments which I would use with FPs and NTs accordingly meant almost nothing to you...  Relatively little sense of humor - comparable with ESTJs. I am at lost... Sometimes I feel like you would be willing to take a step back if I began to... make myself smaller? Like apologize profusely? Show contrition, cry a little? Beg for understaning? Take 10 steps back for you taking one?

Please help!

I want to be able to work with you on anything... but you are like the most diffult people to me. And I don't mean to offend any of you, you are just... like an alien species to me. Perhaps I would be to you one as well...

This is not a troll post! I really am at loss!"
BrainsOut_EU,ENTP,Obviously as respectfully as possible. ESFP have this carefree and nonjudgemental approach to life that sometimes borders on oblivious and naive... And then it's so hard not to say what I want to say and just go on... Can it be done? I'm cautious...
BrainsOut_EU,ENTP,"Maybe it's me being 33M, but I feel the romance, although fun, was way underdeveloped. It seems like Panam fell for V as if bc he was the first solid guy outside Aldocados.

They're only in the here and now. They don't share much of their lifes' stories outside the quest line, their hopes or aspirations, their friendships... I mean there could be much more backstory to this... Also there isn't that much back and forth.

‚Ä¢	Would you enjoy taking on a leadership position? Do you think you would be good at it? What would your leadership style be?

(If I‚Äôm being honest, no I rather just do things solo, I wouldn‚Äôt mind being a leader, I would probably just ask everyone what their idea is and come to a general consensus)

‚Ä¢	Are you coordinated? Why do you feel as if you are or are not? Do you enjoy working with your hands in some form? Describe your activity?

(Not gonna lie, I can be super uncoordinated which makes me at times clumsy as fuck, I love hands on project anything that I can build would be amazing)

(Yes definitely, things have to make sense or I‚Äôll lose my mind. I tend to try and find flaws in people‚Äôs logic, but I just hold my tongue because I usually don‚Äôt care)

‚Ä¢	How important is efficiency and productivity to you?

(Uhm, I mean if it gets done then I don‚Äôt care, sometimes I get lazy and push things to the side too often)

‚Ä¢	What is your learning style? What kind of learning environments do you struggle with most? Why do you like/struggle with these learning styles? Do you prefer classes involving memorization, logic, creativity, or your physical senses?

(I prefer self teaching because I have a hard time listening to people, they don‚Äôt really tell me things in a way I want to learn things, so I end up finding different ways to learn things I‚Äôm passionate about) 

‚Ä¢	How good are you at strategizing? Do you easily break up projects into manageable tasks? Or do you have a tendency to wing projects and improvise as you go?

(I kinda just improvise and bullshit my way through things, I don‚Äôt really care much for strategizing, I end up pushing things to last
Minute)

‚Ä¢	What are your aspirations in life, professionally and personally?

(Being rich and successful/living a comfortable life where I don‚Äôt have to worry about things such as what will I eat, also becoming an inventor or engineer was always my passion as a child)

‚Ä¢	What are your fears? What makes you uncomfortable? What do you hate? Why?

(I fear that one day I could possibly just be bored of everything not being able to just have fun, I have a bit of anxiety but I can handle it, I hate a lot of things, I get irritated fairly fast but mainly because people are stupid)

‚Ä¢	What do the ""highs"" in your life look like?

(Motivated as hell on top of everything and 
driven to learn as many things as possible or just enjoying life)

‚Ä¢	What do the ""lows"" in your life look like?

(Just me not really doing anything but laying in bed trying to motivate myself)

‚Ä¢	How attached are you to reality? Do you daydream often, or do you pay attention to what's around you? If you do daydream, are you aware of your surroundings while you do so?

(I daydream about my life and my dreams pretty often but for the most part, I have a super vivid imagination, but for the most part I do come back to earth often)

‚Ä¢	Imagine you are alone in a blank, empty room. There is nothing for you to do and no one to talk to. What do you think about?

(I would imagine things I could create most of the time or random scenarios like adventures or maybe just lay there and enjoy the time to myslef)

‚Ä¢	How long do you take to make an important decision? And do you change your mind once you've made it?

(Forever. And it‚Äôs pretty easy to change my mind once the argument is given a valid point )

‚Ä¢	How long do you take to process your emotions? How important are emotions in your life?

(I don‚Äôt know? I guess they‚Äôre fine but I get over things fast)

‚Ä¢	Do you ever catch yourself agreeing with others just to appease them and keep the conversation going? How often? Why?

(Yah at times so people can shut the fuck up. Or even because I don‚Äôt care enough about the topic.)

‚Ä¢	Do you break rules often? Do you think authority should be challenged, or that they know better? If you do break rules, why?

(I tend to break the rules within my house only small ones like eating in my room because I genuinely believe it‚Äôs dumb, at work I follow the rules at times when the bosses leaving I would break the rules with a few coworkers to have fun, rules tend to be stupid but I will follow if needs be)"

I am making a test about measuring the strength's of a person's cognitive functions. The test is intentionally supposed to be impossible or extremely difficult for opposite functions. Based on the concept from Carl Jung, a ship without a captain can sail nowhere. The purpose of this test would be to supersede this flat earth concept where the only accepted truths are in the hands of people with PhD or degrees.

The questions are going to be focused on dominant functions and blind spot functions. The goal is not to figure out what your type is necessary, it is to explore the reality that people have limitations. The questions will be timed. We will need to collect volunteer test subjects to place them in an uncomfortable environment (Limit to 1 questions at a time). We will need people to generate those questions."

I want to explore the possibilities further for Se. This single explanation barely covers the surface from my perspective. I personally need to bounce ideas off of other people before the idea becomes solidified. 


So here are some questions.

[ratatatatata](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/terminator/images/a/a4/Arnie-minigun.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20081119201100)

Is Se all about presentation? Say for instance I have trouble conveying wording in a acceptable format. IE: Resumes, essays, articles, replies to emails, or anything along that manner. 

How is interaction between a Se user and a Si user? Is it more effective and easier to understand to just replicate the opposite? 

Se prefers phone, Si prefers email true or false? 

Is Se always aware of their appearance? 

Do Se users follow rituals because they will forget? 

How does one go about explaining complex theory in a acceptable format for a Se user? 

How resistant are Se users to change and how do they change?

Are Se users better at aiming in video games but insanely predictable? 

Where do you find Se users at? Name 10 places if you can.

How does one go about shared experiences if one does not even begin to understand them? IE: Finding these rituals mundane and annoying. However trapped in this rituals because others see them as no alternative. 

Should a Si user in order to survive in the world only communicate in short order and keep their thoughts and intentions hidden?"
Ragnahawki,INTP,Had a dream where my friends parents were talking about how you can get houses for under 100 dollars. Then my friend was backing his parents truck up with the brakes not working and I was behind him. Got ran over several times even though I kept saying stop the car.
MoonTurtle,INFP,"Hey so I am going to be quite frank, direct and make this as compact and efficient as possible.  


Im a 24 year old guy. I come from a problematic upbringing, school background, substance abuse and criminality. I havent had any diagnosis officially, but I would say I am a high functioning person with symptoms of ADHD and ASPD.  


I would say that I never really had a proper role model in life until I started seeing JBP videos. It was sufficient for a while, but having a parasocial relationship gets pretty boring after a while. Ive had other role models that Ive actually been able to interact with through Discord at least.  


I am a person who is painfully self aware. It has caused me a lot of issues with social anxiety and other symptoms of mental illness. I have issues relating and connecting with most people, but I can at least easily attract people with similar problematic backgrounds as me. I think every guy and girl who seems to click with me fast has also been brought up from a very troublesome childhood. 

To the average person I probably come across as insane, unhinged and absolutely crazy. I dont have an issue with this, but I naturally prefer to align my behavior with whats considered socially appropriate to gain the most value out of my interactions.  


I cant really consume alcohol or other drugs that affect my inhibitions as I am naturally kind of fucked up without any substances. After my vacation I am going drug free, at least from everything besides nicotine, caffeine, phenibut and psychedelics.   


My message really is all about allowing people to connect with me. Allowing people who are also coming from a shitty fucking background to have some hope. It will get better. If you continue working on self improvement you will reap the benefits. Most people dont even think they have issues, you have no idea how fast you will surpass most people if you actively work on yourself. Eat healthy, gym hard, establish meaningful relationships and have a job that at least doesnt matter you suffer too much.  


If you have any questions, please let me know below. I dont really expect anything out of this, one comment would be nice at least."
MoonTurtle,INFP,"Hey guys. I'm planning to start mining ETH in 2021, and perhaps switch to other crypto once you no longer can mine it. The plan is to buy as cheap equipment as possible with the highest hash rates. I'm looking at used graphics cards on ebay and local sites. Alternatively purchase high end graphics cards with the goal of reselling them after use.  


I'm completely new to this but I've done some researching last night when I should've been sleeping.   


I'm paying 0.052$/kWH.  
I'm planning to buy the following things.  


150$ (used) The seller offered a complete kit of motherboard, cpu, memory

*  ASUS B250 mining expert, Intel socket LGA 1151   
 Pentium G4400   
 Crucial Ballistix Sport LT 4GB DDR4 2666 MHz 
* Supports two power supplies  


100-160$ (Bid)

* 2x 750w powersupply (DPS 750RB A)  
Including 20x pcie cables (8pin).  


**Alternative power supply**

  
60-100$ (Bid)

* 1000w powersupply HP server PSU  
Including 7x pcie cables 6+2 (assume it's also 8pin?)

&#x200B;

Without spending a single dollar on graphicscard the cost is about 300$ for basic setup.  


Now here comes the question. For a simple starting rig like this one, what graphics cards should I be aiming for? I've found a couple of RX 570 4gb cheap, but I heard that it's more difficult to mine with 4gb?  


I'm using this site to gather hash rates ([https://minerstat.com/hardware/nvidia-rtx-3060ti](https://minerstat.com/hardware/nvidia-rtx-3060ti))  
[https://minerstat.com/hardware/amd-rx-570](https://minerstat.com/hardware/amd-rx-570)

So the alternative here is to either buy cheap older gen graphics card which have the benefit of being cheaper at the cost of efficiency and resell value.

RX 570 for about 60-80$ (used)  
They have 30 MH/s (80w)  
Downside is 4gb, how serious is this downside?

OR  


Buy brand new NVIDIA 3000 series once I can get a hold of them, preferably 3060 Ti. Mine for a year and resell before the next series is released.   


They cost about 600$ each and have about 60MH/s (120w)  


The downside of this option is the I can't buy many of these cards at the same time. I'd have to wait one month for each card, (two per month if I'm feeling spicy). Which would give me less time until the next nvidia series is announced and released. 

Between 1080 Ti and 2080 Ti there was like 18 months

Between RTX Super 2080 and RTX 3600 Ti was 17 months.

Lets say I have about 16 months to mine and then resell the cards at 80% value, lower the longer I wait. 

So the two alternatives ultimately would cost me  


**Cheap alternative** 

300$ For basic fundamentals (probably more if I want some kind of frame)  
6x75$ per cheap graphics card  


[https://www.cryptocompare.com/mining/calculator/eth?HashingPower=180&HashingUnit=MH%2Fs&PowerConsumption=480&CostPerkWh=0.052&MiningPoolFee=1](https://www.cryptocompare.com/mining/calculator/eth?HashingPower=180&HashingUnit=MH%2Fs&PowerConsumption=480&CostPerkWh=0.052&MiningPoolFee=1)

It'd be about 180 MH/S (at best, optimistically) (**11.86$/day** including electricity)

If the entire rig cost about **750$** (excl frame) it'd take about **64 days** to pay it off.   


**Expensive alternative**  
300$ For basic fundamentals   
6x600$ per expensive 3060 ti graphics card (if I can even get a hold of them, fucking miners)  


360MH/s  **$ 24.31/day** including electricity cost  
if the entire rig cost about **3900-(480\*6) = 1020$** (excl frame) it'd take about **43 days** to pay it off.   


If we're being more pessimistic on resell value of those cards, puting them at 60% value:  
**3900-(360\*6) = 1740$** it'd take **71 days** to pay it off.   


&#x200B;

So what are your guys thoughts on this? I'm tilting more towards getting 3060 Ti. However if I can find really good deals on used older gen cards I'm thinking that's a good start for the first rig. Maybe the smarter move is to start off cheap and upgrade further ahead?  


This isn't just for money though, I find this to be very interesting as well and I think I'd enjoy the project. Keeping that in mind it's also important that I don't do something extremely retarded financially, so I'd love some input."
MoonTurtle,INFP,"To make a short introduction.I'm 22, no experience with women what so ever, broke, live at parents atm, I've failed university twice. I lost my last job due to poor work ethics, i.e being a lazy piece of shit. I'm currently working d2d sales as a fresh recruit.

My overall bad habits during my youth put me behind socially, which I'm currently working on.

The things I've done.  


\*Quit gaming  


\*Quit hard drugs and daily usage in general  


\*Maintained a gym schedule, I'm cheating with the diet though. Gone from 84kg to 92kg in almost 2 years. My lifts are 110kg squat, 70kg bench, 42kg OHP, 140kg dl. I'm about 92kg, 6'7 and have a fairly slim build(long arms, long legs, long everything)  


I've done social experiments where I've applied the red pill mindset and it was a fucking blast. I shared some of the context in trp which gave me mixed responses. But regardless of how things went, it was almost an religious experience to step that far out of my comfort zone. The mere concept of being perceived as attractive by the opposite gender has been foreign to me for my entire life. I've just thought things like: ""If I get a nice job and/or degree I'll automatically get women"" or pretty much anything which implies that I am not ready at my current state.

If you were in my situation, what would you focus on at first?"

Feel free to ask me any questions!"

ethan_iron,ENTP,"Edit: I now feel that the MBTI type that fits me best is ENTP, not XSTP.

‚Ä¢ How old are you? What's your gender? Give us a general description of yourself.

I'm an 18 year old cisgender male. I consider my alignment to be True Neutral. I have never been in a romantic relationship with someone else, but I have asked out women a few times. I often create spreadsheets because they help me to organize my thoughts and simply because I enjoy creating them. I consider myself Heteroflexible (I can become attracted to anyone whose sex is female as long as they don't identify as being male). I generally get pretty good grades in school (my current High School GPA is 3.875). I am 5'11"" and I weigh around 215 lbs. I have light brown hair and eyes that can look blue, green, or even grey depending on the lighting; but they are technically blue with yellow around the pupil I believe.

‚Ä¢ Is there a medical diagnosis that may impact your mental stability somehow?

Not that I know of.

‚Ä¢ Describe your upbringing. Did it have any kind of religious or structured influence? How did you respond to it?

I was raised in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints (Mormon) for my entire life. About a year ago I began questioning the church and realizing that I had nothing to prove that the church is actually true. Since then I have realized that even if I lived the rest of my life in the church, I would never have proof that the church is real, so I decided that there's no real point in attending or being a part of the church. Currently, I believe that as soon as my parents let me I will stop being any part of the church.

‚Ä¢ What do you do as a job or as a career (if you have one)? Do you like it? Why or why not?

I don't have a job or career but I have started live streaming on twitch, so I'm hoping that could become a steady job in the future and that I could do that full time. I'm currently a Junior in high school and my favorite class is Criminal Justice so I might stick with that when I graduate if streaming doesn't work out.

‚Ä¢ If you had to spend an entire weekend by yourself, how would you feel? Would you feel lonely or refreshed?

I would probably feel lonely at some points, but I would probably be perfectly fine for most of it. I almost definitely would not feel ""refreshed"".

‚Ä¢ What kinds of activities do you prefer? Do you like, and are you good at sports? Do you enjoy any other outdoor or indoor activities?

I do not enjoy sports and I am not very good at them. I generally enjoy parties and the like, though I typically stick close to the people that I already know. The only other things that I enjoy doing with other people are playing games (video, card, board, etc.) and just talking / hanging out.

‚Ä¢ How curious are you? Do you have more ideas then you can execute? What are your curiosities about? What are your ideas about - is it environmental or conceptual, and can you please elaborate?

I am very curious. I love knowing how things work and it usually annoys me a lot and causes me to continuously ask questions if someone gives me an unsatisfactory answer or explanation. I have a lot of ideas but I usually try to at least partially execute them all. Most of my ideas are about things to do (e.g. spreadsheets to create, challenges to try in video games, different ways of playing games, etc.)

‚Ä¢ Would you enjoy taking on a leadership position? Do you think you would be good at it? What would your leadership style be?

I take a leadership position almost every time that I am in a group project in school. I think I do a decent job most of the time, but I may be a bit to unassertive at times and not explain things in simple enough ways which can cause the other members of the group to not do what I want them to do. I am typically a fairly libertarian leader, allowing the other group members to basically do their own thing.

‚Ä¢ Are you coordinated? Why do you feel as if you are or are not? Do you enjoy working with your hands in some form? Describe your activity?

I consider myself somewhat coordinated in the way that I am able to do put my thoughts into action fairly well when playing video games and creating spreadsheets. However, I am not super coordinated in the way that I'm not always sure of what I want to do when playing games, which can cause me to make a lot of mistakes and can often lead to me losing in competitive games and board games. I enjoy using my hands to type and to use a controller.

‚Ä¢ Are you artistic? If yes, describe your art? If you are not particular artistic but can appreciate art please likewise describe what forums of art you enjoy. Please explain your answer.

I am not artistic unless you include streaming. I do enjoy forms of art that I can interact with or enjoy over extended periods of time such as video games, youtube videos, shows, movies, music etc.

‚Ä¢ What's your opinion about the past, present, and future? How do you deal with them?

I look to the past both positively and negatively: remembering the times that I did and said things that I now feel that I shouldn't have, but also remembering the times I've spent with my friends in the past. I see the present as fleeting and because of that I often try to make the most of it. I usually don't think much about the future unless it's about something that I know is going to happen or things that could have a very large impact on my life.

‚Ä¢ How do you act when others request your help to do something (anything)? If you would decide to help them, why would you do so?

If I was already doing something at the moment then I will usually show and greatly exaggerate my frustration at having to do something else. If I wasn't doing anything I will usually help without complaining at all. In either situation I try to help the people that I care about whenever they ask because I recognize that if I needed help I would want them to help me, and I generally try to treat others how I would like to be treated, and I consider it fair game if someone else decides to treat me the way that I treated them previously even if it isn't the way I'd typically like to be treated.

‚Ä¢ Do you need logical consistency in your life?

YES. I feel that everything that happens has a logical reason for it happening, and being able finding out what those reasons are or being told what they are is often necessary for me to feel satisfied.

‚Ä¢ How important is efficiency and productivity to you?

I hate feeling like I could be doing something more efficiently and if I know there's a better way to do something but I don't know how to do it I will usually stop doing that thing. I don't really care about being productive very much, but I feel that if I don't reach a certain level of productivity that my parents will be upset, and I hate upsetting people.

‚Ä¢ Do you control others, even if indirectly? How and why do you do that?

I do control others to a certain level because I share my opinions and judgements on things very often and I also try to prevent others from doing things that might upset me or the people that I care about. I'm not really sure why I try to influence people, but I suppose I don't usually do it intentionally.

‚Ä¢ What are your hobbies? Why do you like them?

My only real hobbies are playing video games, board games, and card games, watching youtube, listening to music, and hanging out with friends.

‚Ä¢ What is your learning style? What kind of learning environments do you struggle with most? Why do you like/struggle with these learning styles? Do you prefer classes involving memorization, logic, creativity, or your physical senses?

I generally excel at learning when I'm able to listen to lessons and ask questions about what I'm learning. I struggle most with learning environments that require me to do something while I'm being shown or told something, and I'm not able to ask questions. I prefer classes involving logic and I dislike classes involving creativity because I dislike being told to do something that I don't want to do.

‚Ä¢ How good are you at strategizing? Do you easily break up projects into manageable tasks? Or do you have a tendency to wing projects and improvise as you go?

I typically come up with a general plan for a project and then just end up improvising and doing whatever I feel is easiest to do at that moment.

‚Ä¢ What are your aspirations in life, professionally and personally?

I aspire to have a long-lasting relationship that lasts for years. I aspire to take care of an animal when I'm adult.

‚Ä¢ What are your fears? What makes you uncomfortable? What do you hate? Why?

I fear being in a mental state that causes me to forget important things and I fear losing friends and the feeling of not having people to talk to. I become uncomfortable when people say or do things that I feel might be offensive or rude to other people, and I also become very uncomfortable when I'm in an environment that my brain to feel fuzzy or for me to have a headache (often times this happens when I don't have enough consistent airflow reaching my head). I hate bugs because they disgust me and they are just generally very annoying.

‚Ä¢ What do the ""highs"" in your life look like?

The highs in my life are points where I have multiple positive relationships with people (including friends and family).

‚Ä¢ What do the ""lows"" in your life look like?

The lows in my life are points where I don't hang around people that I don't live with.

‚Ä¢ How attached are you to reality? Do you daydream often, or do you pay attention to what's around you? If you do daydream, are you aware of your surroundings while you do so?

I sometimes have difficulty discerning my own thoughts from reality (there are some times that I think I did something when I really just thought about doing it, which can cause me to lapse on certain duties). I don't daydream very much but there are times where I will begin to subconsciously stare at one spot for an extended period of time when I'm listening to someone speak or just thinking. I am typically fully aware of my surroundings when that happens.

‚Ä¢ Imagine you are alone in a blank, empty room. There is nothing for you to do and no one to talk to. What do you think about?

I think about how long this is going to last and why/how I am here.

‚Ä¢ How long do you take to make an important decision? And do you change your mind once you've made it?

I typically take a while to make important decisions (this can range from about a week to multiple months). After I've made a decision I often look back and think about if I should've made a different decision than the one I've made.

‚Ä¢ How long do you take to process your emotions? How important are emotions in your life?

It usually takes me a little while to process and understand my own emotions and why I am feeling them. Emotions are no more important to me than they would be to the average person. I generally have to try not to hurt other people's feelings, but I think it would be better if people used their emotions to guide them less.

‚Ä¢ Do you ever catch yourself agreeing with others just to appease them and keep the conversation going? How often? Why?

I do agree with others to keep conversations going, however rarely. I typically do this because I love conversing with people and I will try to keep a conversation running even if that means I have to say something that I don't actually agree with.

‚Ä¢ Do you break rules often? Do you think authority should be challenged, or that they know better? If you do break rules, why?

I don't often break rules unless I feel that they are unnecessary and that there will likely be no negative consequence for me doing so. I think authority should definitely be challenged because I believe that no one person is better than another, we're all just different. If I break a rule it's usually because I think that it would be fun to do so and I don't think there will be negative consequences for doing so.

EDIT: I've now decided that I'm almost definitely XNTP, not XSTP. Regardless I would love to hear your opinions."
ethan_iron,ENTP,"I have found that so far everytime I bring up shifting people either say ""sounds fake"" or just dismiss it entirely. I just don't get it like at all. I mean there's no harm in trying it. All of the information about it is free, so worst case scenario: it turns out to be fake and you wasted some time, maybe messed up your sleep habits temporarily, and maybe you feel embarrassed because you ""fell for it"". Best case scenario: it's real and you become a FUCKING TIME GOD AND WHATEVER ELSE YOU COULD POSSIBLY WANT TO BE! I mean how is it even a question??? Like you might as well try it! Maybe it's something where like only certain people are open to it and those are the people that are able to do it, or maybe it's because they're consciousness is focused on a different reality, or maybe they're like an NPC or something so they're just actually incapable of accepting it? Sorry for ranting but I just don't quite get it."
ethan_iron,ENTP,"So as I stated in one of my previous posts on r/shiftingrealities I spent over 2 hours earlier today scripting my DR, WR, and LIFA App.

When I was creating the script for my WR I basically scripted it to be similar to some kind of spaceship or the TARDIS from Doctor Who. The reason I consider it similar is because it's fairly simplistic with only having doorways that lead to different realities and a bench in the middle. When I sit on the bench a panel shows up that allows me to change my script and look at the different realities that I've been to. The other reason I consider it similar to a spaceship or the TARDIS is becauee it has an AI that can interact with things that I say and do and will say bye to me whenever I leave my WR.

I'm considering making my WR my Primary reality, but I'm not sure how that would work. Regardless, I think over time I will grow attached to my WR and will probably have many different conversations with it. It will be like a companion that will always follow me on my adventures and that I can always retreat to.

TLDR: I scripted my WR to be like a futuristic space ship. I wonder if any of you have done the same?"
ethan_iron,ENTP,"I just spent over 2 hours writing a script for my DR, WR, and LIFA App. My script is very detailed and takes up ten front-to-back pages of my dream journal. I think I spent that time as productively as I could have.

Never be afraid to script what you want. Remember: you are your consciousness and your reality is built on belief; the more you believe something, the more real it becomes.

We are all going to shift tonight. I know this because every time you try to do something there's a world where you succeed and a world where you fail. So we are all going to shift and we are all going to not shift tonight.

Keep going! You're literally guaranteed to get it eventually!"
ethan_iron,ENTP,"This has probably been asked before, but I can't find anyone else asking so...

The way I look at it there are 3 reasonable outcomes. 1) the consciousness that was in that DR before you just returns, 2) when you decide to leave there's always a version of you that decided to stay, or 3) you leave the body in that reality with no consciousness and it becomes a husk.

1) If the consciousness that was in the DR before you comes back, that creates even more questions (e.g. do they know that you took over for them? are they aware of what's happening in their CR while you are there?). Personally I don't think that this is correct, but it's possible

2) I find this theory the most plausible and the one that makes the most sense. I believe that most likely every time that we decide whether or not to do something (e.g. whether to return to CR or not) we create 2 realities; one in which we decide to do that thing, and one in which we don't. Hence the infinite multiverse. I also believe that whenever we try to do something we also create 2 realities, one in which we succeed and one where we fail. Because of this, I believe that there will always be a reality where we never manage to shift because we fail every time and there will always be a reality where we stay in our DR because we decide not to leave every time.

3) I find this theory the least likely. I really doubt that we create big problems like these when we leave a reality, but it's technically possible.

What are your thoughts?"
ethan_iron,ENTP,"I was wondering if people here know of easy ways to import certain things into the game (e.g. Cup of coffee and bird plush on Monika's desk). I also wanted to change the background and give Monika some different clothing options, but I'm not sure how to implement any of that. I saw a few people with things like that on this subreddit so I figured I'd ask."
ethan_iron,ENTP,"Sorry about the title; I had to think of a somewhat SFW title that would convey the subject of this post. I will be trying to keep this at least somewhat 'professional', but it is about feeling symptoms in my Penis, so...

Last night I went to bed hoping to have a lucid dream so that I could shift. After I began trying to go to sleep I started to feel very strong symptoms all over my body (especially in my left arm). I tried not to focus too much on the symptoms and I went to sleep. I proceeded to wake up ~2 hours later with a raging boner. I decided that I needed to do something about it so that I could go back to sleep so I started masturbating. When I was close to finishing I felt what felt like shifting symptoms in my penis. I ejaculated shortly after and then cleaned up and went back to bed, but I did not end up having a lucid dream or shifting. 

I think it kind of makes sense that I felt symptoms in my penis because in my DR I will be in a romantic relationship with my ""comfort character"". I am curious to know though if anyone else has experienced anything like this, so if you could let me know that would be appreciated.

While I was laying there trying to go to sleep, I started feeling very strong symptoms (for me it was my left arm particularly feeling very tingly). I tried to not focus to much on the symptoms and just go to sleep. I'm not sure what happened from that time to 4:30, but I assume I probably went in and out of sleep a few times. At 4:30 I went to the bathroom and then tried to go back to sleep. However, my stomach hurt really bad so I couldn't. At 6:00 after an hour and a half of trying to go back to sleep I decided to eat something so I walked to the kitchen and ate a snack and then went back to my room and fell back asleep within 1/2 an hour. After that I went in and out of sleep alot and woke up at 10:30 because my stomach hurt again. I realized that because I had been having such a restless night I had probably only gotten ~7 hours of sleep, so I went back to sleep and woke up an hour and a half later and then I finally got up and ate lunch.

TLDR: I felt really strong symptoms at first, but then I went in and out of sleep over and over again without ever having a lucid dream or shifting."
ethan_iron,ENTP,"You don't have to admit it if that's the case but I'm curious to hear if there is anyone willing to open up about their experience shifting to this reality. I know a lot of people say that most people wouldn't reveal to the people in their DR that they shifted there because people won't believe them, but on this subreddit people are likely to believe you, so it would be nice to hear some stories."

Got up this morning and on my way to the toilet, I *immediately* got distracted by trying to find the minimum angle at which my open bedroom door swings completely shut (with the lock clicking into place) on it's own after letting it go, without additional physical aid or force. Tools used: Protractor (at door hinge), String (to measure attempts from the door hinge) and Boredom (because fuck my life)

It's 38¬∞ degrees you sons of bitches! Woohoo, GOT IT! Amazingly useless data! *lights cigar*

Alright, good talk guys. Thanks for listening. Btw, what nonsense inventive ways are you coming up with to combat your boredom right now?"
1Zer0Her0,ENTP,"**TL;DR: ENTPs like discussing hard-hitting facts, sometimes very abrasively. Most people find it hard to respond to well, and then think that they are now arguing. So technically, it is the responding party that actually likes to argue, to win the altercation as a contrarian - ENTPs simply try to explore the truth.**

Hello. So I just thought to myself, sitting staring out of my window after having a BS argument with my roommates about them being in denial about some random BS (I'll digress, before I ramble about that); ENTPs don't actually *like* arguing per se, ENTPs like to discuss an idea with their friends because of how rational, helpful or innovative the ENTP thinks it could be. A lot of the time though, it might come across as TOO innovative or TOO cold and calculating/rational, and the receiving party feels as though it's an attack, causing them to go into the fight (often fight) or flight response, thus deeming the interaction as an ""argument""

It might be an argument *now*, but it didn't *start* that way! I don't *want* to argue, but I want you to understand and for you to possibly question your own ideas (just as I do with my own) much more than I don't want to argue, and I guess all of the extrovert in me doesn't want to just stop talking or recede...It just *feels* as though I'm attacking you, because you are now responding from the **fight** of your **fight/flight** response. I think it's wise for ENTPs to **figure out how to not come across as predominantly argumentative**. I prefer ""incessantly inquisitive"", because even though no-body should have to do all of these freakin' mental gymnastics in any given social setting, ENTPs are more than capable of it...so why not, eh? - it may help in **actually getting what you want** in the interaction, and by extension in life. Plus, arguing is actually mentally tiring...I need the brain energy to (not) finish my plethora of stupid projects. \*big yawn\*"

blackdeath1278,ENTP,"Ok so the girl in question is an INTP and I'm asking this here because you guys have faced simillar problems and may be able to help...

Sooo yeah.
Before I go further lemme clear this up.
We ain't using labels but yeah, the nearest defined thing we have to refer to us is dating.
So as y'all know, we've been stuck in lockdown for 1.5yrs, I knew this girl for 2 years, and we bonded pretty well. She's an INTP, and my age[19]. She's had about 7 boyfriends the longest of which was 7 months. She had a toxic trait of wanting people to love her instead of trying to love herself( I know this is a very bold statement to make, but I can't just put down hours of talk in here). For me I've had one relationship for about a year. Other than that, I was involved with another girl; and well long story short, I misread signs and shit and ended up hurting myself.
So now to the crux of the matter.
Well I am a person who needs human interaction, and since I don't have many friends, it's only a couple I talk to, she's one of them. She is very intravarted, and doesn't reply on text much. Me on the other hand crave talking to someone I like and respect. So yeah you guys can probably see the problem already. I basically try to talk a lot, but she has a lower threshold of interaction. This would've been fine ig, but what makes it bad is that, I have a trauma regarding people not answering my texts[previous shit] and not to help I've an anxiety problem and OCD[I take meds] . She has lots of stuff too(infact that's one of the reasons we're close, we have faced some simillar problems). So yeahhh this is what I wanted to ask.

How would I approach telling her that id like to talk to her more without sounding too pushy or desperate?"

naraaa26,ENTP,"I hope daddy Musk would come up with a pill that can feed us for the whole day or week, i'd buy it to save my time wasted for cooking and chewing. I think it's because we have Se demon, we hate sensory things and eating is the literal example of it. Most instagram foodies are ESXX basically Se doms. I think Se doms are the types that are most prone to addiction (sex, eating, drugs, alcohol). We have Ne, so our addiction is basically our own thoughts. And eating is such a chore to me, it sometimes get to the point where i'm hurting from hunger pang then i'd grab some food to eat it with my PC. Anyone else agrees with me?

Edit: Many ENTPs agree with me. Another reason to believe in MBTI.

Edit #2: Eating feels great, but the reason of it being a necessity makes me sick. Why do we have to experience pain if we don't eat? Those genes refuse to die, they manipulate our brains to send us the pain signal and torture us until we give them the nutritions that they needed. **Why** do we *have* to stay alive, it only benefits those genes! We didn't choose to be born! Life in itself is torture and pain.

Edit #3: So basically it goes like this;

You: **working**

Your genes: Oh no! We need more ATP (protein from food)! The human needs to eat in order to keep us alive! *send hunger pang signal to brain*

You: Oh no! I have no food! Guess i'll die

Your genes: what?!?! **UNACCEPTABLE!** *send even more hunger pain signal to your brain*

You: please stop, i'm hurting

Your genes: I don't care if you're hurting! I just want ATPs!!! Give me ATPs or else i'll die and make you even more in pain!!!

You: but i don't have food or money-

Your genes: *send hunger pain to brain until it can not be more hurtful than this*

You: *just want to get rid of the pain*

Your genes: *do not give a fuck about you as a conscious being and only care about their survival*

You: **die**

Your genes: **die. Mission failed. Respect -100**

You: **dead and painless. Happiness +100**

Now you, as a living being.

You: i want to die.

Brain: no! I want to survive!

You: but, i want to die-

Brain: **no**

You: *nod slowly and just wait until life gets magically painless.*

Sadly, pain comes with life. Perfectness=flawlessness=needlessness. We are not perfect because we have needs. When we die, we become one with the universe, we become painless. But yet, our monkey brains don't care about us as conscious beings. They only listen to those damn selfish genes.

Edit #4: ATP comes from high-protein foods like meat. So uh, same thing.

Edit #5: Some people are crying ""bUt lIfE iS gREaT yoU'Re jUsT eDGy!!!"" No, you are lying to yourself. Life/nature is horrible, animals devour each other alive in the wild. Accept that.

TL;DR: Life sucks. Death is the only way to reach eternal happiness. But don't do suicide. Because it'll hurt your loved ones..."
naraaa26,ENTP,"**Never say to an ENTP that they talk too much**. My ex bestfriend said that to me in 7th grade and i immediately avoided her. ENTPs talk that much because we want to entertain you, and if you say that it comes off as if you're not appreciating us. We also have this kind of 'trust test', and if we talk to you more than anyone else it means you have surpassed that test to some degree, but if you say that we are too much we just think you don't appreciate our effort of entertaining you and you failed the trust test immediately. My current bestfriend surpassed the 'trust test' and now i feel safe saying and doing anything around her because i know she accepts me for who i really am. ENTPs wear masks on a daily basis, finding the one that surpasses the 'trust test' really ties us up to our inferior Si and we will be extremely loyal to you. I know because even after 5 years, i still appreciate the memories with my ex best friend before she broke my trust. Because she was once my safe ground.

velvetdrips,ENTP,"Hello! I (19) am a senior in college about to graduate with my BA in psych this summer. However, I realized a bit too late that I would be a much better psychiatric NP than counselor and should have gotten a nursing degree instead. Now I‚Äôm a bit conflicted as to what my next move should be. 

I could take a few years to see what relevant work I can get with my current qualifications and save up some money for more school. However, if there is any affordable way to do it I would prefer to get qualified/working directly in the field ASAP. It seems that the latter path could potentially involve some kind of accelerated BSN and/or MSN program (I have already taken most of the prerequisites). However, I‚Äôm not sure how legitimate/affordable/efficient these programs are, so feel free to weigh in. 

Knowing all of this, what would you recommend? When it comes to this job/specialization, how important is getting into it early? If I were to go back to school now, what could I do to minimize the cost? As it stands, my lack of means to cover the cost of tuition/time off work is what is giving me the most hesitation, particularly given that my household relies primarily on my income right now. If anyone else has made the transition from a psych BA to a psychiatric nurse practitioner I would love to hear about your experience!

L0ganH0wlett,ENTP,"So as the title suggests, I have many friends/acquaintances. Every weekend I'm usually having out with 2 or 3 different friend groups or alternate to another friend/group of friends on the weekends. On one hand, its great! There's different dynamics among the friendships and relationships. Some people I can joke and banter with, some we have common passions and can talk about them endlessly, and some I can have intellectual debates or discussions with no need to worry about fallout. 

That being said, I feel like i have no deep connections with anyone. I like my family, but I just dont feel incredibly connected to anybody in it except maybe my mom. The only time I feel like I get that kind of emotional connection is in an romantic relationship. And needless to say, that can quickly lead to them being an emotional dump for me which is by no means healthy. Im aware of that and trying to figure out what the hell to do about it. 

Im talking to someone now and she seems to understand that, and is she is very appreciative that I have the self awareness to work on these flaws and anxiety. Plus it seems like she appreciates more depth and openness about stuff like this that Ive been giving her. But yeah, Im definitely worried about the anxiety getting in the way of a romantic relationship. I stress and worry about opening up emotionally in a romantic relationship and getting burned because I opened too much too quickly or attach to quickly, or the sheer stress from it makes me seem crazy and then they don't wanna deal with it. 

Do any other ENTPs have an issue like this? If you have, can you give me some advice or thoughts on how I can better handle this emotional anxiety/worry/whatever the hell you wanna call it? Or better yet, how to feel that kind of connection with people so that a romantic relationship doesn't become an emotional dump and I can better open up to others? Or is this something I should accept and look for a partner who accepts it and   just builds trust so it goes away? (Which I think in a couple months time it would go away naturally. There's definitely more an initial stress to opening up emotionally than when the trust is established)"
L0ganH0wlett,ENTP,"TL;DR: I want to understand Ne and Se differences better, as I can't really determine 

Okay, so to preface this, I know MBTI is not an end all be all, but I do find that it can be helpful for better understanding thought processes and self improvement and increased learning.

That being said, I'm trying to figure out if I'm ENTP or ESTP at this point. Can someone explain to me Ne and Se as they function as both dominant and demon functions? 

I've been reading more into them, and they both heavily apply to me. Like it's weird how much both apply. 

I love trying new things and pursuing new hobbies. But a lot of my consistent hobbies are sensory experiences. I love trying new foods and restaurants, I love beer, taste, recipe making, culture, figuring out why certain beers taste the way they do, etc. And MMA and physical training is another huge hobby of mine. Partially because the endorphins and adrenaline helped with my depressive disorder and loving the post workout feeling, but I love the strategy and endless possibilities I can use to win a fight after I observe my opponent. A lot of times when I learn something I think about its applicability to work and life as a skill, but I throughly enjoy philosophy and meaning and concepts. I actually thoroughly enjoyed my essays on book analysis in school. 

And I love debating and talking politics. One of my ideal nights would be going to a low key bar and just having discussions about politics/what could solve certain problems and beer science/tasting, but I also love spending nights by fires and just enjoying the atmosphere of it, or going to a tailgate and enjoying that atmosphere.

However, I do think I have solid adaptability in a crisis mode to notice my surroundings and adapt to solve the problem in the time being. 

So I mean I love new experiences and physical sensations, but ideally when I'm in my free time, I want to be engaging people in deeper conversation. And my mind is always floating off into different things about possibilities when I'm not focused on work. If I'm doing real work, my mind is focused on whats in front of me, what the results are, and why its happening (Im a lab tech essentially for an as an entry-level chemical engineer). 

I have always thought I was an ENTP, but studies in my interests and looking into Se more has me questioning things lately, especially with how applicable both functions are.

What I'm trying to determine is how Se/Ne function as demons and maybe I could figure out more from there with some thought? 

Thanks for any advice in advance, and I'm willing to add any additional info if you need any more!"
L0ganH0wlett,ENTP,"TL;DR: I'm bored, please help brainstorm temporary hobbies

Okay you beautiful, genius bastards, yous! 

I need help. I'm in a lockdown county right now and I need help figuring out a new hobby/interest because of limited availability of pretty much anything. I cant sit and read fiction or watch netflix for more than an hour at this point.

I also realized I'm probably not the only one with this problem right now, so I figured a list of brainstormed ideas from a bunch of geniuses on temporary hobbies would be great! This is easily the best place that could recommend temporary hobbies. 

I'll throw some current interests below for some context and some things I've considered, but literally any recommendations would be great for the benefit of other bored ENTPs in quarantine. 

My passions: MMA, health/fitness/nutrition,
beer (brewing, tasting, style differences, history, culture, etc).

Interests: bourbon, lyrical hip-hop, cooking/trying new foods, tea, cigars/pipes, psychology, stories (movies, books, games, any kind of deep story)

Any hobbies or discussion about any of these for further research would be great! And then literally anything you all are doing to cope with the soul sucking isolation of quarantine."
L0ganH0wlett,ENTP,"Like the title says, I'm looking into Fox folding karambits. I'm just looking to see what kind of feedback anybody had on the knives themselves, the 479 vs. 599, the company itself. Any feedback is appreciated!"
L0ganH0wlett,ENTP,"I need some advice about potential romantic interest from a bartender. TLDR is at the bottom.

For backstory, I've been going to this bar pretty frequently the past couple months and have gotten to know this bartender pretty well. For the sake of ease, we'll call her ""S"". The conversations are always fun, I ask S to make me something new any time I'm in, as she loves making cocktails and trying new ones and having me try new ones she likes. On slower nights like the Sundays, she'll talk with me way more, ask me to move seats to the sink so she can talk while cleaning glasses, will stay after her shift is over to talk with me more, etc. Any time I'm there, it feels like she's super interested. That being said, I tip decently. Not just her, but everyone at the bar, usually $10 if it's just her and the tab is $30-40, or $15-20 if its above $50 tab or there's 2 bartenders. I bartended briefly at a brewery, so I understood the appreciation behind an extra couple bucks. 

Now, for the mixed signals part I need help figuring out.  Every time I am in, she definitely goes out of her way for conversation when she's not in a stressed mood, loves to have me try new drinks she makes, and always says no the first couple times I ask for my check so I'll stay longer (even tho she knows I won't order anything else and will always give her the same general tip as described above). She asked me deep questions about my personality, how I am in relationships, how I was shaped into the person i am, about my values and why I'm interested in what I am, detailed questions about my sex life, and other questions friendly bartenders dont usually ask. She gave me her number as soon as I asked a little over 2 weeks ago, and was very playful and bantering about all of it.

Now, she's very, very difficult to get ahold of via text. No idea why. I tried making a date and that fell through the weekend after she gave it to me, and then it happened again last week. We were saying that thursday night could work, but she might have plans and wasn't too sure. But there was little to no texting back except apologizing at 4 AM the night that she is a terrible communicator and it's something she's working on. Not a problem, but she's been incredibly difficult at getting a hold of still.  This lead me to asking her point blank if she really was interested this past Friday, and I'd back off if she's not and just have things go back to the way they were before she gave me her number. She looked me dead in the eye and told me she was interested. She promised me she'd let me know Sunday night if she's free this week to go out, but I haven't heard from her. I know this past weekend was stressful for her so I've kind of just given her space since sunday as I know she's really introverted in her spare time and probably needs to unwind. I'm not trying to be pushy about anything and I'm trying to walk the thin line between showing interest and not being pushy or a dick about anything.


I guess my biggest question to all of you, is if she's gotten into a web of being afraid to lose me as a regular who she enjoys talking to and getting a decent tip from, but doesn't know how to tell me she's not romantically interested. And if so, what's the best way to tell her it doesn't matter and I'd rather just keep having the fun nights at the bar for both of us? The only reason I'm not just doing that is that I know I can start to emotionally withdraw from women I'm interested in but confused by (I won't go into the reasons why cuz, I dont think are important here). I dont want that withdrawal to come from my complete lack of understanding, so I'd rather have advice if any of you could offer it. I mean this all may be caused by something else  I would never consider without another POV.  I'm not worried about feeling like a fool who got played by someone taking my money, it's just complicated to describe it. I dont like not understanding the situation I suppose. I have no desire to manipulate the outcome of this situation, I just want better understanding. 

Thanks for the feedback and time.


TLDR; Am interested in bartender who initially showed interest in me. Shows a lot of interest in me in person (moreso than what one would expect from a friendly bartender), but is terrible at communicating via text. I need help understanding what the deal is and how to just resume the fun conversations and bar nights without assumption of romantic interest."

L0ganH0wlett,ENTP,"So as the title suggests, I'm interested in getting into pipes. I was looking for suggestions on tool brands, pipe brands, and tobacco brands (as well as which ones to avoid). I've been smoking cigars for about 5 years now, but have very little expertise in pipe smoking. I have a budget of about $40-60 for a pipe itself, so I was unsure if it was worth getting a briar pipe with that kind of money. I also have another $40-50 or so for tools and such. Any feedback is greatly appreciated!"
catgau,INFJ,What is the best singing advice you know and how did it help you? It can be about any aspect of singing.
catgau,INFJ,"# Which plugin would be your number one choice in this specific context? 

So I bought plugins during the 2x2 sale last weekend.

I still have three free plugins to choose from. So I got free demos for the most interesting ones. The demos will expire tomorrow and I still can't decide.

It's mainly for producing electronic, house and pop music. I'm especially into vocal production, but I'm trying to sharpen my mixing and mastering skills at the moment.

**Here is a list of plugins I already own:**

* Abbey Road Saturator
* Abbey Road TG Mastering Chain
* H-Delay Hybrid Delay
* H-Reverb Hybrid Reverb
* S1 Stereo Imager
* Vocal Rider
* DeBreath
* Doubler
* Renaissance Axx
* Renaissance Channel
* Renaissance DeEsser
* Waves Tune
* Vocal Bender
* Also got most Goodhertz plugins (vulf compressor).

catgau,INFJ,"TLDR; Any thoughts or stories about going to One or going to Two is super welcome. It benefits all of us to read about your unique experience.

Do you have any specific experience or advice to share with us regarding the growth paths for this type?


For those who don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôm referencing in the title or if you need a refresh, here‚Äôs a extract from the Complete Enneagram by Beatrice Chestnut (which I‚Äôm currently still reading):


>The direction from the core point along the arrow line is the path of development.  


>The ‚Äústress-growth‚Äù point* ahead (Type 2) represents specific challenges perfectly suited to expanding the narrow focus of our core personality (Type 4).   


>This brings Type Fours in direct contact with challenges embodied in Type 2: allowing for a balance between self-referencing and other-referencing, between meeting your own needs and meeting the needs of others, and between being your authentic self and adapting to others.   


>Under stress, Fours can act out the lower side of Two by giving compulsively to be liked, or giving up what they need in an attempt to buy others‚Äô love or acceptance. 


>The ‚ÄúStress-growth‚Äù opportunity is using the high side of Two to bring themselves out of their self-absorption, intense feelings, and isolation, find creative ways to express who they are and opening themselves up to connect with others. In summary, it's about working on the self-deprecating tendency.  


>The direction against the arrow from the core point (Type 4) to the *‚Äúchild-heart‚Äù point* (Type 1) indicates issues and themes from childhood that must be consciously acknowledged and owned so that we can move forward and not be held back by unfinished business from the past.   



>This ‚Äúchild-heart‚Äù point (Type 1) represents qualities of security we unconsciously repressed, occasionally fall back into as a confort in times of stress, and now must reintegrate consciously.   



>This calls for Type Fours to reclaim their ability to use self-evaluation, self-discipline, and structure as ways to support themselves rather than as ways of devaluing and punishing themselves. The Type 1 strategy of trying to be good as a way of earning approval may not have worked if they had to cope with an overwhelming sense of loss or deep feelings of deficiency.  



>Fours can consciously draw on the strengths of the One point, using them to gain the support they need in their growth toward the Two Point, by taking action to manifest their ideals.


>Regular patterns and repetitive work can help a Four find peace and containment amidst a life in which they can get lost in the ups and down of their shifting moods. By reincorporating their ability to work hard in support of improving themselves or others, Fours can take action and feel more powerful and confident, which can support their growth and development instead of holding them back in a search for something they lost in the past. 



Also in the book she says the antidote to Envy is Equanimity.

I would love to read your thoughts on the growth paths for Fours and on Envy vs Equanimity.

Or any thoughts or personal experience relating to any of this?"
catgau,INFJ,"I was looking at the CS joseph typing grid, and I noticed something.

It seems like affiliative archetypes (SJs and NFs) prefer extraverted judgment to introverted judgment, and pragmatic archetypes (SPs and NTs) prefer introverted judgment to extroverted judgment), but not all of them, which made me more curious:

So i looked at the exceptions, and they are ENTJs TeNi, INTJs (NiTe) who are pragmatic and prefer extraverted judgment to introverted judgment.

ENFPs (NeFi), INFPs (FiNe) who prefer introverted judgment to extraverted judgment.

I thought maybe extroverted judgment makes you more affiliative because you care about aligning with outside values or principles. So what's the deal with NTJs and NFPs? Seems to be something about Ni+Te and Ne+Fi that changes the pattern.

What does it mean??? Thank you.
