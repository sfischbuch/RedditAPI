Some Sagy traits - “Sagittarians are optimistic, lovers of freedom, hilarious, fair-minded, honest and intellectual. They are spontaneous and fun, usually with a lot of friends, and are perhaps the best conversationalists in the zodiac”

Chrissyxpello,ESFJ,"Hello all 💞
I’m reactivating my Reddit account to get some advice to help my current relationship. 

My boyfriend is an ENTJ and thinks that we should break things off, when he said this I got really upset which lead him to suggest we spend some time apart from each other instead.

He said that we aren’t right for each other and I don’t know how to prove to him that we are the perfect match?

When I’m with him I feel amazing and happy and I always do my best to care for him and give him my everything to make sure that he’s smiling, so this came as a big shock for me and left me in tears.

Mbti has taught me that his type can be abit mean and inconsiderate of others but I think we’ve worked through this and I know he always wants the best for us. I bake for him every evening and tidy his flat whilst he’s at work leaving him gifts and presents all the time, this decision he made seemed to come out of nowhere to me and I wondered if his feisty Aries side could be the cause? I’m not sure but I’m feeling very lost apart from him and need advice x"
Chrissyxpello,ESFJ,"Hello Reddit!💖💖

When I’m not working or at dance class I like to enjoy my spare time in various ways:

Doing my makeup, cleaning and decorating my house (fairy lights and fluffy pillows), Playing with my little dog, doing some gardening if the suns out, and finally baking! 

I seem to see cooking as an ESFJ stereotype but I personally prefer to bake!💓 this made me question my type for some time but I then realised after speaking to loved ones that I am an ESFJ xoxo

What is your type and what do you enjoy doing in your spare time xxx?"

Chrissyxpello,ESFJ,"I dated an ESTP before but he was quite mean to me and ruined my reputation when we broke up (not gonna go into it but i was left in tears crying). I think he was immature but he still hurt me allot and I would never go back to that place.

I dated an ISFP but he moved far away and left me alone with no one. All I had was my girls to cheer me up and get me through the breakup.(they were lovely and even came to visit me with chocolate and blankets x)

Recently I’ve been focusing all my time on dance friends and family, but now I desperately want to find a boyfriend again especially for the new year.

So any experiences or advice for compatibility would be amazing💘💘"

Dynamite223321,ESFJ,"Hellowww lovely cinnamon rolls! Hope yall are doing okay.  I'm an ESFJ who probably hasn't met an ENFP before for which I wanna know u guys better. Also I wanna get some advice from yall about how I can develop my Ne since it's my 3rd cognitive function and it's your dom function. I'm trying to work on it by taking baby-steps like, making some adjustments in my drawing (I like to draw) and stuff like that. I might even start story-writing.

My question: What's your worst fear (Not as in phobia like: Arachnophobia or something but stuff like, fear of abandonment or something or not being able to be yourselves. JUST AN EXAMPLE) and what do u struggle with the most? Also, what's a thing u guys HATE? Like, as much as I learnt from the MBTI world about u guys (I might even be wrong) u guys don't like to be bossed around or something like, u guys dislike it when u aren't given the liberty to think outside the box or your creativity has to be suppressed or something.

ejpintar,INTP,"Did anyone else here like really f**king not like high school? Like I know college isn’t just gonna be some dream land, I have to work to make it q good experience but still HELL YEAH"
ejpintar,INTP,"So I’m trying to type everyone in my family and my dad has proved the most difficult for me. I think he’s an ENTJ, although his personality doesn’t match up *perfectly* to common descriptions of the type, the 4 dominant functions definitely match up and he even tested as an ENTJ so I felt pretty good about it. The thing is, when he was a kid, he was very quiet. Like, very quiet. He’s told me that when he was in elementary/middle school he would spend most of the day reading by himself, was very timid, didn’t have any friends at school, and would often go days without anyone hearing him speak. So it seems like he as a child could not *possibly* have been an extrovert, even though as an adult he’s become very sociable, open and gregarious. How should I think about this? Has anyone else faced similar dilemmas in typing people?"
ejpintar,INTP,"I've often heard it said that before the publication of the Luther Bible, there was no single standard form of German, and as a result it became the basis of the standard language after it was published. If that's true, how did Luther come up with a standard language for his bible? Is it influenced by his local variety of German, or was there already a rough standard language that he just standardized more precisely?"
ejpintar,INTP,"I first noticed this when I was looking at historical religious statistics in Germany. Germany has been majority-Protestant for most of its history since 1871, but in recent years rates of irreligiousness have grown and there are now more Catholics than Protestants in Germany. This means that more Protestants are losing their religion than Catholics, right?

Then I started thinking about the rest of Europe and the pattern seemed to hold up across the continent. Historically Protestant countries like Denmark, the Netherlands and England all have high rates of irreligiousness while Catholic places like Italy, Spain and Poland and Orthodox places like Russia, Greece and Serbia seem to have mostly maintained their religion. The only exceptions I could think of to this were France, which has a particular history of secularism because of the Revolution, and the Czech Republic, which has been associated with Protestantism and irreligiousness for many centuries.

In my home country, the United States, there’s a concept of “Cultural Catholicism” whereby a lot of people who may have grown up Catholic or have Catholic families lose their faith but still participate in the religious ceremonies because they still identify with the culture of Catholicism despite their lack of religious belief. But on the other hand, I’ve never heard of anyone being a “Cultural Protestant”.

It seems like the Cultural Catholicism thing may be at the root of it in Europe too, but if that’s true, why is there no major concept of Cultural Protestantism? In other words, why do Protestants who lose faith just leave the religion while Catholics who lose faith seem to often stay with it? Maybe there’s something I don’t understand about the religion as a non-Christian person, but either way I’d be curious to understand where this imbalance comes from."

giraffarigboo,INTJ,"Hello INFPs. My brother is very much an INFP. I was reading up about your type because I've been reading about my entire family, and in an article about INFPs there was a section talking about how INFPs can often struggle in ""normal"" jobs because they want to do something they feel morally good about. As an INTJ with a pretty strong Fi function, I definitely agree. However for my brother, it has gotten to a point of career paralysis. He keeps trying new jobs and just canNOT. He really wants to be a writer, and just wants a job for the moment to support himself at the bare minimum so he has time to write. Has anyone had a similar obstacle in finding steady work, and if so, how did you overcome it?"
giraffarigboo,INTJ,"I’m pretty new to studying the cognitive functions so this could be way off base. But every time I see someone type a typical detective character on the internet, they type them as an XNXX. I feel like this is actually the intuitive bias in the MBTI community causing us to assume that every intelligent character is intuitive. 

There are two particular TV detectives that I think are actually Se users, and these are Sherlock Holmes as portrayed by Benedict Cumberbatch in Sherlock and Shawn Spencer from Psych. The majority of the internet seems to think Sherlock is INTP and Shawn is ENTP. 

In both shows, whenever the detective stumbles upon a crime scene, the camera pans to all these small details they notice that most people would never catch and then they take all these sensory details and put them together to come up with what happened. They are able to pinpoint precisely which details help them come to that conclusion. This slightly falls apart when they then use these details to predict where the perpetrator will be in the future, but that could just be Ti. This is not the future-oriented innovation of Ne. That said I haven’t seen either of these shows in a long time and I do recall Sherlock coming up with some new forensic techniques which I could see an INTP doing but idk. 

Basically I think it’s plausible that Sherlock is an ISTP (which I think a lot of people agree are some of the most “intuitive” sensors) and Shawn is an ESTP. 

Does anyone have any thoughts? I’d love to see what people would say on the flip side so I can get a better understanding of the functions. 

I mainly used this article and some descriptions of Ne and Se on this subreddit to come up with this theory.

giraffarigboo,INTJ,"I’ve searched past posts and there hasn’t been an in depth discussion on this in a few years. 

I’m a woman in engineering school, and hoping to get an internship in the next couple of semesters. I was wondering what people have to say about current gender relations? I can find the statistics about what percentage of each field are women online and I have no problem being primarily around men, but I’m wondering if there’s any difference in treatment by management and coworkers. I know that a lot of people resent women in certain fields due to the possibility of only being there due to affirmative action. Has anyone experienced this in ChemE? Are there any particular industries to avoid for this reason? Responses from any genders are welcome."
giraffarigboo,INTJ,My answer along with some analyses of people I commonly play with will be in the comments.
giraffarigboo,INTJ,"Over the past few months, I've noticed something strange on a street I frequently use. The street is in between a train station to the city and a small local airport. Every day on the sidewalk right outside the entrance to the airport, there will be a man wearing a wind breaker jacket with a wagon surrounded by canvas fabric like [this.] (https://www.woodscanada.com/products/woods-outdoor-collapsible-utility-king-wagon-225-lb-capacity-green?variant=31639429120137&currency=USD&utm_medium=product_sync&utm_source=google&utm_content=sag_organic&utm_campaign=sag_organic&gclid=CjwKCAjw47eFBhA9EiwAy8kzNNHeQhaIX_VomBNPyQSHl8Re2FiL8P5jgIjIjnQtbs7hRkyTWzjlWBoCdkQQAvD_BwE)
 
The weird thing about it is that every day it is a different man, or at least, there's enough different men that I can't keep track of them. I can never spot what's in the rolling cart, but it doesn't look like he's selling anything. It wouldn't make sense if he was because pedestrians never use that street and it's not near a light where people stop their car. Every time I drive by one of these guys is there, same jacket, same wagon, different face. Usually he just stands there, but one time I saw him urinating on the street. I also find the wind breaker odd because in my area, temperatures are getting up to 90ºF right now. 

 Does anyone know what's happening or why the men are there? The first time I saw it, I assumed it was a homeless man who rode in from the city using the train, but now it has been going on for months and the fact that it's a different person each time is just baffling."
giraffarigboo,INTJ,"Tl;dr: Physics 1 was not my favorite course. It might've just been a bad prof. Is this a sign I shouldn't do ChemE and I should to Chem instead? 

So I'm between choosing a ChemE degree and a Chemistry degree. I was a math major for a while, but when I started my advanced courses, it was almost all really boring proof writing and not any of the applied problem solving that I loved. I really like Chemistry, Applied math, and CS, so I thought ChemE would be a good choice. I decided to apply to transfer to an engineering school and this semester I took some pre-reqs and other classes that would transfer.

One of the courses I took was physics 1. I thought I'd really like it because I like math and problem solving and the physics parts of calculus. However, I hated it. I'm not sure I hated it because I disliked the course material itself. There were some things I thought were interesting. I once took a physics of music class as an elective, and i thought it was the coolest thing ever. I just had an awful prof and it soured physics for me. 

I was reading online that ChemE is a lot more physics than chemistry and this worried me. I will be taking physics 2 over the summer and I don't need to decide on my transfer until July. Should I just rule out ChemE now and do Chem instead, should I wait and see how physics 2 goes, or does it not really matter that this one class sucked??"
NajaRastahl,INFJ,"Dear ISFJ, I want you to know how much I love and appreciate you. You are such a kind, gentle soul... 

Supportive and helpful of everyone in need and devoted to your cause or job no matter what it is. You are such a hard working and inspiring person. Whenever I see you putting others before yourself... Something in me just melts... It makes me want to be there for you so you can continue doing that.

I like that I can just easily make you happy with the little things. Like getting you a favorite meal for work or leaving notes on your desk, or a good, long hug..

&#x200B;

You make me see things in a perspective I could only dream of. You take in the world purely as it is and experience it through your senses.. For that reason you enjoy being in nature listening to all of it's magnificent sounds and smelling all the pleasant fragrances.. And feeling the wind. I find that very cute.

You remind me that life is a sensational experience and that there is much to see, hear, smell and feel. and that makes me feel very whole..

&#x200B;

You are also very intelligent and modest. You use your skills and abilities to make the world a better place. To me you are an irreplaceable person.

&#x200B;

I want you to know that you are not alone... even if you face hardships, I'll always be there for you and  we'll make sure to overcome them together.

&#x200B;

All of this is truly from all of my heart.

NajaRastahl,INFJ,"Hey guys :)

As you probably know, humor is a great tool to lift someone's mood or even help them going out of a negative emotional phase. I myself really love entertaining people and lifting up the mood in a conversation or a group scenario (even better)

But sometimes I struggle to find what to say even though the intention is there. I know that INFJ have a serious attitude / nature and when I was younger, I really didn't want to make it seem like i'm fooling around too much, I wanted to keep a respectable reputation. Over the years I grew up I realized how important humor is to daily life and to a healthy mental lifestyle.

What is your thought process like when you go into a humorous mode? How do you get into a mode that you are able to make fun of everything?

&#x200B;

For me, I'm still working on it but I'm trying to see things from a more Ne perspective, trying to imagine new things and creating ideas upon existing groundworks. Sometimes it will come naturally, sometimes I will need a little push. This also involves funny puns or word games.

Another way is to utilize the high criticism skill that we have in order to take an object or a person (without hurting their feelings) and criticize them in a funny way, adding imagination on top of it."

le_artistic_madlad,INTP," ""Sexy"" is a derogatory term. We do not condone usage of such terms because it obscenely objectifies women and because we do not acknowledge basic human sexual desire. And even when we do, we cancel.

le_artistic_madlad,INTP,"""[This](https://youtu.be/VA-SXCGwLvY) is a wonderful story from Lacan's clinic as told by Suzanne Hommel, in analysis with Lacan in 1974.

As a young girl when war broke out, Hommel had experienced at first hand the occupation of her country by the Nazis, and recounts this story from her psychoanalysis with Lacan which dealt with her memories from this time.

starfuckeryy,ESFP,"I had an entire weekend to study for my math test tomorrow but instead I choose to avoid studying for it and procrastinate by using my phone instead??? I KNOW from experience that I'm too stupid to grasp concepts fast - I was revising completing the square yesterday for 3 HOURS and I still couldn't understand for some godforsaken reason - but nooooo I run away from the problem and do NOTHING to revise until the last minute. 

Is it really that difficult to get myself to just study? I'm not even diagnosed with ADHD or anything else, but yet I find it so difficult to start on homework of any kind. I'm sure that I don't have ADHD too because once I actually start on the task, I can focus quite easily. 

So now I'm stuck in a never-ending cycle of procrastinating because of my fear of failure, inevitably being disappointed in myself when my results come out and repeat. And due to my stupid decisions, I'm going to fail my test tomorrow because math is my worst subject and I still have 5 more topics to study (which I probably won't complete because it takes me hours to understand the simplest of concepts).

It's so pathetic considering the odds are stacked in my favour - I don't have family issues, financial issues or overbearing parents. There is no valid reason for me to avoid studying (my overwhelming fear of failure is just an excuse). I've already screwed up all of my tests so far - English, Elective History, 

 I'm so frustrated at myself because due to my stupid decisions I'm going to screw up my tests for this term and disappoint my family (again)."

these thoughts keep popping into my head in matter how much i try to block them out. i've been fixated on these thoughts for the past few days and it's been screwing up my daily life (e.g. i wanted to do homework but then i started getting anxious and didn't want to do it anymore). it's not too severe but i'm scared that it'll get worse.

Adamite63,ENFP,"Alright so I realized an interesting thing about personality when it comes to the cognitive functions. It seems obvious it's just that intuitively it's easy to miss. One of the reasons that it took me so long to figure our my type was because of the E vs I component, but in the end, whether or not someone is extroverted or introverted doesn't matter in the slightest because only the cognitive function order determines the type. Because of this, the contradiction, at least with cognitive functions, is that while someone may be an extrovert, their type can easily be an ""Ixxx"" type, which seems to be the case with me. 

(I'm extroverted regarding energy more so than socially extroverted)

Let me know your thoughts and I'd love to have a great discussion about it 😁"

Might we make an assumption ESFJs wouldn't be interested in typology, but as ESFJs are people centred, it doesn't make sense we see so few around reddit.   
But I find ESFJs the most warm, supportive and stylish, sometimes even the smartest. I wish your kind to prosper.   
It's just an appreciation post.   
Don't be ashamed of being an ESFJ around these circles. Don't let any ""intuitive"" garbage put you down.   
Peace"
Notseed,INTJ,"I can't write with my hand since school. My handwriting was always terrible, but I didn't bother to learn because we live in the digital age. I never liked handwriting, maybe it has something to do with me being a southpaw.

Notseed,INTJ,"My mom says that she grows spiritually. How do I understand it?    
I do catch her drinking strong spirits (not like the horse Spirit) occasionally.    
But how is that growth?"
Notseed,INTJ,"I know it's not related, but do you happen to be on the psychopathy spectrum?   
I watched a video how a psychopath described what it's like for them.   
One thing that really drew my attention was lack of certain emotions. I knew already that I've never felt guilt, love and emotional bedroom fun arousal before. But the other thing I found out is that people actually feel FEAR and STRESS as an emotion. I have the same bodily reaction as she described. I do feel the physical presence of the adrenaline, but it doesn't affect me emotionally in any way.   
I am pretty sure I am not high on the spectrum. I do still feel sad sometimes and I have some empathy or sympathy. But can you relate to anything?"
Notseed,INTJ,"I just remembered that my grandma had two brothers and they effectively didn't share the same personality type. One was rather timid, calculating and quiet while the other one was bold, relaxed and carefree. Sadly, they're both dead long ago. What is it like for you?"
Notseed,INTJ,"Is there everything okay with me that I haven't talked much with people lately? Apart from my grandma (once a day on phone) and myself I don't really talk to anyone. I just feel like it's kinda wrong, but I neither even have anyone to talk to nor do I have a lot of time. 
But I enjoyed voice calls with interesting people much. 
Am I weird?"

Notseed,INTJ,"I got typed by a professional as an INTJ, I always suspected I were one, but the only thing I couldn't relate to is that I am not introverted.   
I cannot relate to introversion. I don't get tired from social interaction all that much, but it ires me when I can't do things that propel me forward, because of socialising.   
I don't socialise a lot, but I do it regularly.  
I like speaking on the phone too.   
And I absolutely need to ""vent"" in a way, share what's going on in my life.   
I don't like to shut up and I talk to both people and myself a lot.   
The person who typed me said that being lead Ni doesn't mean you're an introvert, it means that you like to narrow down instead of expanding, like with Te.   
and also that person who typed me said that my extraversion is due to my enneagram.   
My enneagram is 3w4 and tritype is 387.  
What is your enneagram and how do you relate to this?"
Notseed,INTJ,"Please help me not feel like am too unique in that regard.    
It's that when I am with a girl I focus on her to the point I don't care about my own experience all that much and I feel bad if I don't get to ""perform"" my best for her.   
Please tell me that you relate"

what_did_i_do_wronge,ENTP,"hi well i'm a 17f (but i go by he/him pronouns) heigth:1.57 m ( 5.15  in feet, weight:53 kg(116 lbs) race:hispanic medical issues: i dont have any i dont drink.smoke or take any recreational drugs i curruntly live in mexico.

now the promblem: never thougth of myself as mentally inastable, but i ways always describe as weird,imature and excentric person and i was bullied my entire childhood because of it and i never had any friends except in recient years even tho im not a shy person. i  was/still am bad at reading(i read two grades below the level i suppost to have) and matematics and i still have a sligth speach impediment and even thougth i am consider a ""smart"" fellow i failed on the most basic things like memorizeing/hearing simple things like a short list,names, or something i was told  with in a few minutes but ironaclly i have a facinating long term memorie, and i have a family history of mental illness from my fathers side i dont know all but the closes relatives are my uncle that has squizofrenia,my mom has syslexia and my youngest sister has adhd so chances are a bit high.i started supecting that somrthing wasnt rigth with me when my mom came to me to complain that who im not like others kids my age and then pointed out a list of things that are wrong with me according to her i'm:

* i don't listen/have a hearing problem
* bad memorie
* terrible social skills and social unawareness
* no selfawarness
* don't understand/respect autoraty 
* lack of comun sense
* bad in matetmatic and reading numbers
* lack of sympaty and emotions also unawer of others emotions,expressins and body language
* imature for my age

and she just told my i should solved this and see if it's a metal ilness and i did. so i did i origanally thougth it maybe a personality trait and i was just rude or distracted, but than i actually did some research and after two years i found out that i shared most synthoms for autism/asperger like:

* Sensory issues: i am very sensitive to sounds and i cry because a asmr video is too much for me and im pretty clumsy with stuff
* Lack of adherence to social rules: i personally dont see it but i get reminded a lot of it. and im a bit problematic or tend to piss of people with autoraty like teachers,parents,older people.
* trouble makeing and maintaing friendships
*  troble reconizeing emotions:i know the concepts of feelings and what is sadness and all that but when it comes to practice i fail to understand why the persone is like that all of the sudden and how do i fix it it even worst for my own emotions since i dont know how to describe them or dont expirince them very often i also dont know how to regulate them.
* Exhibiting strong, special interests: i easly get obssed with things and i do anything possible to keep learing about them and keep them fresh and i get a bit depressed when school,work or my choirs dont let me enjoy things that i like, also adding to the fact that i was always a hoader with stuff rocks,art supples,neat garbage,stickers,cards ect,im also quite petty and annoying when something im intrested in comes to topic and something is off and there you have me giveing an explanation no one ask. 
* eye contact:i can maintain eye contac i just feel sligthly intimidated when that happens.

i also took the  **RAADS-R**  and my score is above the test threshold values and  clear my mind on this and it also possible i migth  slip a dignosis because growing up we were broke and my mom tends to notices things but doesn't do anything about it on its time because its not a problem yet, and as we all can see this became a problem. 

am i really am autistic or is something wrong with me or is this normal 17-18 yo behaviour?"
what_did_i_do_wronge,ENTP,i have done research in autism but not that much on asperger and what i found digging deeper in the asperger syndrom is the one of the main difference is that someone with asper is more sociable or likes to socialize but doesn't know how mean while someone with autism isnt sociable and doesn't want or enjoys socializeing (or at least how i compreheand it) but every other page i see tend to compaired both so that leaves me unsure to where the line starts
