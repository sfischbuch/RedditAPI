redzjiujitsu,ESTJ,"Forgive and forget, yes. But I can't forgive someone who led me on, lied to me a countless amount of times and then manipulated me. I was so blind and infatuated, and yes that's my mistake but why do I want her just to message me back once more so I can reply with a backbone and expose all the times I caught her in a lie, something I never did during the relationship because she hates ""confrontation"". 

I let it all slide and she gets to walk away thinking she did nothing wrong."
redzjiujitsu,ESTJ,"Long story short, my friend is beginning to look unhealthy, and doesn't want to start working out while the rest of our friend group works out.

&#x200B;

We actively began a ""workout"" challenge as a group and he didn't want to join as well so I have no idea how to motivate him. I'm trying my best to tell him that since we're still young (26) and ""starting"" to get these ""aches and pains"" the best time to start working out an ensuring mobility for the future is now but none of that' working."
redzjiujitsu,ESTJ,"I recently came across a TikTok video of a guy who had said something that resonated with me really well and I wanted to know if this was a common theme amongst ESTJs.

&#x200B;

His therapist had told him ""you seem like you have everything going well in your life, why do you need therapy, you're a great brother, a great friend, great employee, great father and great husband""

He had replied ""thanks, but I don't feel like I'm great enough"" 

The therapist replied, ""brother is someone you are for your siblings, friend is someone you are for your friends, employee is someone you are for your job, father is someone you are for your son and husband is someone you are for your wife.""  


Who are you for yourself, who are you outside of those roles? I'm not sure there is much of a person after all that. 

And this made me really think I don't know this answer. It hurt to even think about it. I have like 3 hours of free time that I'm not doing something for myself, everything I do is to become ""better"" whether it's a hobby or my job I just always want to be a better ""something"" 

I like being a great friend to all my friends, I like being a great child to my parents, I like being a great older brother to my sister and her friends, I like being a great cousin to my cousins. I like being a great employee for my company. 

But when it comes to myself and being great for myself I don't even know what that means

redzjiujitsu,ESTJ,"Long story short I don't like having a ""rotation"" or ""options"" I'm too busy to entertain more than one person so why do people always tell me I need to have options to seem ""attractive"" and not ""needy"" I'm not needy by any sort but I do tend to invest time into a girl when I do pursue her. I just can't do it to several people"
redzjiujitsu,ESTJ,"Whenever I try something new, or put forward some effort toward something I feel the need to be ""GREAT"" at it. I'm pretty sure this comes from having tough parents as a child who wouldn't give me credit unless I placed first place in sports or got good grades.  What this turned into was beating myself up when I don't do well in something. 

  
What are some ways of enjoying the moment opposed to competing for success in every little thing"
redzjiujitsu,ESTJ,"I have a handful of hobbies that I like to participate in and would like to continue to participate in. Outside of my job (flexible hours, I'm a software dev PM) I'm grateful to be able to participate in sports like brazilian jiu jitsu, golf, tennis, soccer as well as practice coding and learning new recipes.

Because of COVID I had a hard time adjusting to my lack of hobbies and having a lot of time available but I kind of got my groove towards the end by journaling, reading and therapy.

I noticed I got into a short relationship/fling, mainly because I was bored without my hobbies and actually was able to afford the time to be in one. (Was a big heartbreak tbh)

With the pandemic coming to an ""end"" how can I maintain the ability to keep these hobbies and have a relationship?

On average, I spend about:

1. 10 hours a week doing BJJ (@ the gym+recovery) - Weekdays
2. 4-6 hours playing golf (Either Saturday or Friday)
3. 2 hours playing tennis (once a week)
4. 10 hours practicing code (1.5 hours a day)

My time management skills aren't terrible right now as I meal prep, have set times to do chores around the house etc. but my calendar (i calendar all these hobbies btw) is pretty colorful.

&#x200B;

For reference: I have a fearful avoidant leading anxious attachment style, which is kind of why these hobbies ""*help""*? "
redzjiujitsu,ESTJ,"Long story short, I hate sitting down and spending time by myself, I like to constantly be on the move, was wondering if this was the same with y'all and if it isn't how do you do it? 

I understand it's healthy to be alone sometimes and relax but I find it so boring!"
redzjiujitsu,ESTJ,"Hey Everyone,

I'm posting this here because I'm sure the anxious attachment people have more experience dealing with this than others.

I'm in the process of reconciling with a DA. I'm an FA and we're in the process of reconciling it's been a month of us ending no contact and we've been talking and we worked out our past. (we broke up because I came on too strong, it was a rushed relationship, we were friends first) 

I've recently noticed she's been going through some rough patches right now, should I move in closer to her or let her solve it for herself? My anxious side is kicking in and I want to help her out but I'm not sure if this is the correct strategy."
redzjiujitsu,ESTJ,"I'm in my mid 20's and I have a lot of close friends, about three different social groups of 3-5 people and we're all super ride or die for eachother.

Amongst these groups I have different hobbies that I share with each of them. Is this a bad thing? I do struggle with spending time alone sometimes and the pandemic + isolation has made me realize that so I've sought out therapy to figure out why.

Nevertheless, I'm not a people pleaser or anything nor am I needy person I just feel like people always comment that I have so many friends and I was wondering if it's a bad thing."
Managicall,INTP,"I first saw this subreddit mentioned on r/banned and browsing its posts I found some really great and passionate subreddits mentioned there. It seems the r/AgainstHateSubreddits members are high karma redditors and moderators solely dedicated to cancelling other subreddits by planting garbage posts and report spamming. The comments on that subreddit are for the most part soulless one-liners seeking to bait one sided dialogue.

Managicall,INTP,"""Last night I got anonymously placed into an enormous group chat against my own free will and noticed some of my friend list had been hijacked in as well. There was no way to leave it without being reinvited or committing a friend list deletion massacre. Yes I realize the cliche as it does sound like the plot out of a SAW horror flick or this latest battle royale genre. But it was one of those usual hate groups with a Matriarch and incompetent suitor going about getting spooked and attacking other distracted users whom don't want to be a third wheel to their broken relationship.

This is something I would like to avoid and just relax in my downtime. But no, the social media platform apparently had a ""Code of Conduct"" one of those corporate things that does not acknowledge the demarcation between user and service thereby drafting us to police their chats reporting away. Now this group not only reported me to the administration therein but also most likely followed an officially mandated link to twitter passing the buck helping them dox me with yet more slander and harassment.

Apparently this marketing 2.0 craze that has hit the Internet involving Code of Conducts is geared toward cult indoctrination, profiting off the breeding of new users for the kinder demographic and I am some how to blame for this couples sterility. But this is not agriculture, we are people. If I am forced to babysit these losers then do I not deserve restitution. I owe no civic duty to these corporate overlords especially when I am a paying customer.

I'm just an individual so perhaps I don't speak for everyone and certainly not so in this case when forcibly cut off from my friends that give me love and support. However if you strike me down and ban me then you will not only lose the support of a customer, but have a martyr with a lot of time on their hands. Make me a Hero at your own peril, ""Don't be evil"" and at the very least stay out of my pants with your CoC.""

The time has come where we want to start playing together since I got back into the game. Today we're both adults. Would it be alright to add another WoW account to our Bnet and we would pay two subscriptions but our progress would be shared instead of starting a completely new one with 0 progress on it.

Also would it be a big deal if he were to move from our home one day and we would continue to play on this shared Bnet but two different accounts?

Miloslolz,ESTJ,"Decided to make another thread explaining my issue in more detail and after doing quite a bit of research and testing. Essentially one of these mods is causing my game to CTD and corrupt my save after a short while of play. 

Essentially I start a new game, play fine for like 30 minutes. Finish up Helgen go to Riverwood and I decide to close the game. Upon startup again it CTDs every time. I remove some mods to see if it fixes it (if at least I can enter the game now) and I manage to get to my character but it always says my save is corrupted. 

Here's the [plugin list](https://pastebin.com/RqhqJkqx) and here's the full [mod list](https://pastebin.com/C79wAJ1K).

Essentially I think I narrowed it down to these [following mods](https://pastebin.com/he9qiivd)  (basically all the script heavy mods or environment mods that I thought might be incompatible with each other) . 

I'm missing a few compatibility mods but they're pretty minor and shouldn't be causing any sort of crashing (mostly to make some mods use a certain feature of another mod etc.)

Backstory:
My (21 F) bf (23 M) and I were supposed to go to a restaurant for our anniversary but moved it up a month. 

We both work a lot and so we barely talk throughout the week. He decided to go to work on the day of our date and ended up having to cancel because he got off late. 



I have been really looking forward to this date and seeing him, and for him to just work and cancel really bothers me. It's not like he had to go to work, he offered. We had a plan, we agreed on said plan, and he just cancelled. 

He wants to see me today but I don't want to because I am upset. I even cried earlier. I kind of feel like I am overreacting.... I don't know.

I hold people to such high standards/ have such high expectations that I take every wrongdoing or ""personal failure"" personally. I get very passionate about the lives of people that I care about. I also tend to want to change my significant others/ friends.

In relationships, I attract fixer-uppers. *(I am kind of bossy so that may be why I attract that type of person.)* I find myself redoing resumes/ changing wardrobe and somewhat living their life for them. I cannot help myself. But then I get to a point where I realize that no matter how much I change them, they will not ever be good enough. I have this need for perfection and want the person I am with to not be embarrassing (I am easily embarrassed.

For example, my ex was perfect in every way, only he did not read rooms very well and it was embarrassing

This may be kind of long so, I am sorry in advance.

&#x200B;

**1.** **Priorities**

I am in school for civil engineering. He is not in school or working, but has told me that he has been working on getting a job or going back to school. I go to school out of state so, in order for me to see him, I spend about $200 roundtrip to catch the trains and visit. I budget for that so, my issue isn't having to pay the cost by myself every other week. My issue is that when I come to see him, he will leave me for hours (usually around 4) to hang out with his friends and smoke. He knows that I take off of work and pay to see him, but I guess that does not register for him. I never just show up, I ask him weeks in advance if the days work and he tells me that it does. However, he still decides to leave me in his house alone. He sees his friends every day (he does not work or go to school) so when he leaves me to go out with his friends, I do not feel like a priority. I am in school full-time with two jobs and I tutor and I even make time to at least give him a weekend.

The first time I brought this up, he made it seem like I had a problem with his family. He said. ""I told you that family comes first"". But when he told me that in the beginning of the relationship, I didn't think that that meant that his friends wanting to hang out and smoke trumped his plans with me. He knows that our weekends mean a lot to me because I am graduating in a little over a year and I have no idea where I am going to end up. As a result, I attempt to spend as much time as I can with him now, but I cannot get him to understand that.

On another occasion, he wanted to go to his friend's house on one of his weekends with me so, he took me with him. He knew that I had a train to catch at a certain time and he left me at his friend's house while he did only God knows what. I ended up missing the train because ""he lost track of time"" and that ended up costing me $150.

**2. Money Management**

As I stated earlier, he and I come from different backgrounds economically. He does not work and so I pay for all dates and he regularly asks me for money. Me being the person that I am gives him money whenever he asks. I work hard and save my money so I tend not to mind giving him money. He does not buy anything for me. Although, there was one time he did buy me a chocolate bar.

There are three things that bother me in particular.

1. He spends all of his money on smoking. So, he will find himself buying weed then asking me to pay for gas for his car or food for him to eat. Or he will have no money at all but ask people to loan him money so that he can smoke.
2. We went on a vacation and he knew that I wanted to go to a higher-end restaurant. His response was to spend all of the money that he set aside for eating at the outlets buying things for him and his friends. He asked me to pay for his meal and I agreed. The next day he spent more money at the outlets while I had to save my money in order to pay for his meal that evening.
3. While at the outlets, he said, ""I would ask you to buy this for me, but nevermind"". Meanwhile, his whole outfit (hoodie, shirt. pants. and sneakers) was paid for by me. I just don't know what more I can offer him.

**3. Comments/ Lack Thereof**

He says things that just make no sense at all and then when I correct him, he gets mad at me. There was an instance where he was cursing at construction workers out of the window because he did not feel as though they should be working at night. I explained to him that they were just doing his job and that his response was not warranted and he told me that he did not care and stopped talking to me.

Prior to us getting into a relationship I went over my Myers Briggs letters in great depth because I know that I am an ESTJ with a strong J. (Granted I am acting like a straight-up feeler with how I am handling him). So, I tend to want to plan things out and not aimlessly do things. So one time while at the mall, I wanted to look at the map to search for a particular store. His response was to yell at me and tell me that what I was doing was stupid and that he will find it by walking about aimlessly.

(Lack Thereof): I recently received a phone call while he was next to me where I received news that I was being offered an internship. I was really excited and he knew that I was nervous about internships for the summer. I told him and he said nothing, his demeanor was almost like ""whatever"" which made me feel some type of way. I am not really sure why he wasn't happy or why he could not even say congratulations.

**4. Random** 

I try to take him to different restaurants and give him new experiences, but he doesn't tip. I think that is so embarrassing so, I carry cash when I am around him so that I can tip after he leaves. 

&#x200B;

I know that I am young, but in relationships, I cannot get myself to just give up. I have to be able to say that I tried everything that I could. I think that everything is fixable, but I think that things are building up. I can assure you that he is really nice and always helping me when he can, I just do not know if I can get over these 4 things.

As I stated earlier, he and I come from different backgrounds economically. He does not work and so I pay for all dates and he regularly asks me for money. Me being the person that I am gives him money whenever he asks. I work hard and save my money so I tend not to mind giving him money. He does not buy anything for me. Although, there was one time he did buy me a chocolate bar.

There are three things that bother me in particular.

1. He spends all of his money on smoking. So, he will find himself buying weed then asking me to pay for gas for his car or food for him to eat. Or he will have no money at all but ask people to loan him money so that he can smoke.
2. We went on a vacation and he knew that I wanted to go to a higher-end restaurant. His response was to spend all of the money that he set aside for eating at the outlets buying things for him and his friends. He asked me to pay for his meal and I agreed. The next day he spent more money at the outlets while I had to save my money in order to pay for his meal that evening.
3. While at the outlets, he said, ""I would ask you to buy this for me, but nevermind"". Meanwhile, his whole outfit (hoodie, shirt. pants. and sneakers) was paid for by me. I just don't know what more I can offer him.

**3. Comments/ Lack Thereof**

He says things that just make no sense at all and then when I correct him, he gets mad at me. There was an instance where he was cursing at construction workers out of the window because he did not feel as though they should be working at night. I explained to him that they were just doing his job and that his response was not warranted and he told me that he did not care and stopped talking to me.

Prior to us getting into a relationship I went over my Myers Briggs letters in great depth because I know that I am an ESTJ with a strong J. (Granted I am acting like a straight-up feeler with how I am handling him). So, I tend to want to plan things out and not aimlessly do things. So one time while at the mall, I wanted to look at the map to search for a particular store. His response was to yell at me and tell me that what I was doing was stupid and that he will find it by walking about aimlessly.

(Lack Thereof): I recently received a phone call while he was next to me where I received news that I was being offered an internship. I was really excited and he knew that I was nervous about internships for the summer. I told him and he said nothing, his demeanor was almost like ""whatever"" which made me feel some type of way. I am not really sure why he wasn't happy or why he could not even say congratulations.

**4. Random** 

I try to take him to different restaurants and give him new experiences, but he doesn't tip. I think that is so embarrassing so, I carry cash when I am around him so that I can tip after he leaves. 

&#x200B;

I know that I am young, but in relationships, I cannot get myself to just give up. I have to be able to say that I tried everything that I could. I think that everything is fixable, but I think that things are building up. I can assure you that he is really nice and always helping me when he can, I just do not know if I can get over these 4 things. 

&#x200B;

TLDR: My boyfriend presents possible red flags. I do not feel like a priority to him and he has problems with managing money. His comments are not always smart and he doesn't seem happy for me when things are going well for me.

khadijb,ESTJ,"I have been dating my boyfriend (22 M) for a while now, but whenever I have a problem with something that he does, I cannot talk to him about it. It isn't his fault and this isn't something that only happens with him, it's been with anyone that I've been in a friendship or relationship with. 

He assures me that we can talk through anything and that he is here for me, but I cannot get myself to find words to describe how I feel about situations. 

For Example: I found a dating app on his phone and it took me 3 weeks to mention it. He spent a whole day asking me what the problem was and I could not even say it. I had to type it on the computer next to him. 

I have no idea why I am like this, but I don't think that this is healthy for a relationship. I love my boyfriend, I really do, but he was literally on the brink of tears because I am ""hiding myself from him"" despite him being there for me. He has to beg me to talk to him when there is a issue, but by the time I am ready to talk.... I have already shut down... 

Is there any way to better my communication problem? Should I break up with him? I just feel so bad for hurting him. 

Tldr: I can't talk about problems with my boyfriend (even my issues with him) and that hurts my boyfriend"
khadijb,ESTJ,"I (20F) am having trouble with my boyfriend's (22M) family, but I am worried about discussing it with him. I think that it would cause more issues. The main issue is with his god brother who is more like his brother. They are really close and they tell each other everything and if my boyfriend is not with me, he is with him. I didn't realize how close they were until  the brother told me that my boyfriend tells him everything about our sex life despite me asking him to keep it private. My boyfriend justified telling his brother by saying that his brother told him about his girlfriend. The brother recently told me that the two of them are moving in together and I need to accept that and get used to see him all the time. 

Everytime I see my boyfriend, he brings his brother and his brother's girlfriend. It feels like I am on a double date everyime we go out. I am introverted and I don't always want to be bombarded by people. He never warns me that there will be other company and I guess they assume that it is ok. Everytime he picks me up, the three of them are in the car and I would much rather just be with him.

Aside from that, the way that they talk to him angers me. The brother's girlfriend called him and told him ""come pick me up right now"". She doesn't pay for gas or anything, the least she could do is be respectful. There was an instance where she told him to "" Shut up"". The brother talks down to him too and bosses him around and it is just disrespectful. 

They are also disrespectful to me and he will just sit there and say ""that's just how they are"". I really like him and so I just ignore it for the sake of our relationship. He really wants his family to like me, but it has been increasingly hard for me to stay quiet. I don't think he gives them the "" I want my girlfriend to like you"" talk. One time the brother told me that I was stupid for going to college and I am not mature because I live with my parents while in college. He called my father a liar once too. 

I want to bring these things up, but it won't be a private conversation. I know he'll tell his god brother and his god brother will tell his girlfriend and his mom. And considering that all of our dates are double dates, I don't want it to be awkward. I don't know how to say bad things about his family without being rude. And I fear that anything that I say will be taken the wrong way. We have only been together for about 9 months and we have never bumped into an issue before. I don't know whether I should keep it to myself to avoid issues with the whole family or if I should say something and risk his god family not liking me. 

It is important to note that I love his actual family, but his god family is really hard to handle. He says that they all like me, but I am not really fond of the god family. I am really trying to ignore it, but it's gotten to the point where I have not agreed to meeting up with him because I don't want to deal with them.

TL; DR: My boyfriend's family is disrespectful to me and him. I want to address it, but we haven't been together long and I don't want to cause more issues."

Riverrdog,INTP,"I don't think I'm very unique. I don't think I stand out a lot. I like things that are generic and mainstream, and even my appearance is no-effort in a normal way. Heck, I don't even dye my hair or try to look interesting in any way. I speak very normally and say very ordinary things, yet time and time again people tell me I'm strange or that I'm creepy and intimidating.

At first I thought it was just bullying, but then my teachers started telling me that as well. That my brain is different and wrong. Although my grades recently have been bad, I've always been a well-behaved student. I never act out or talk back, I never try to disrespect those in charge or cause disruptions to the class in any way. So why do they think I'm bad?

There was even one time when my science teacher suddenly told the class that I was psychotic and ""belonged in a mental ward"", just because I was making a joke to my friend about zombies after she mentioned the topic of cannibalism in class (which, come on. It's tangentially related.) Since then, everyone's been telling me my brain is wrong and broken and bad.

I don't understand. I'm doing everything right. I'm trying my best to fit in, but people keep calling me a freak. I don't understand why people shun me so much when I'm just the most normal and basic person ever. Nothing about my personality stands out, so why I am being ostracized?"
Riverrdog,INTP,"Hi, INTP here trying to climb out of a depressive slump. I've lost almost all my ambition and hope for the future, and I've been trying to regain them but it's really hard.

I've heard that ESTJs are some of the most hard-working and ambitious types, and it honestly baffles me how it's possible for people to have any motivation at all, at this point. I want to have motivation to even do the things I enjoy, but I can't even do that, and that stresses me out.

So my question is this - as an ESTJ, what motivates you to do your best every day? Is it something intrinsic, or is it family or friends or maybe even something else?"
Riverrdog,INTP,"I'll try to keep this as short as I can but knowing myself I'll probably ramble on regardless.

My school life is in shambles, I fell asleep during my Physics and Biology finals, I have no real goals or motivation in life (I do have some semblance of goals but I'm not motivated to work towards them regardless of how much I try to hype myself up and how much I genuinely love them), I've shut myself away from all but one friend and I can't seem to find a way to fix myself.

I feel like everything about me is fake, and even the feeling of being fake, I feel like it's fake. I feel as though I'm forcing any emotions or thoughts I have, and I feel like my personality doesn't truly belong to me. I even feel like all my symptoms are faked until I look at how terrible my grades are.

I also believe I may have been experiencing tactile hallucinations, as throughout the whole day today, I've had an odd sensation of my heart moving around in my chest in a way that it shouldn't. It's not always like that. It's normal until it suddenly happens, then when I try to focus on identifying the feeling it becomes hard to discern and disappears until it appears again. A few days ago I've also had the occasional feeling of being jabbed by a needle under my skin even though there's nothing there.

Should I seek psychological assessment, or is this a normal person type of thing that I've blown out of proportion?"
Riverrdog,INTP,"(Edit: I'm 18F, Asian living with my parents, for clarification.)

Earlier today, I was having an online counselling session with my therapist, and I brought up to her that I believe I may be experiencing tactile hallucinations, which I've read are actually quite common. However, this seemed to actually somewhat annoy her, as she advised me to stop constantly labelling my symptoms and seek a clinical psychologist instead, because it's not my place to self-diagnose my symptoms.

A bit of a background - I've never sought out any psychological assessment before, nor consulted doctors for any mental health issues. The most that's happened is when I saw my GP in 2018 for my near-daily panic attacks, only to be told it was just due to extreme stress.

Earlier this year and last year, I was going through a pretty terrible depressive episode (I believe), in which I almost completely neglected schoolwork, withdrew from my friends and family, and refused to do bare minimums such as filling in exam registration forms until I was two months overdue. However, that low feeling dissipated a few weeks ago, and now I feel more able to feel balanced.

On what I believe to be tactile hallucinations - the whole day, I've been having a strange sensation of my heart being pulled downwards. It's not painful, and I have no difficulty breathing, but it's still weird. When I try to focus on it to discern what exactly is going on, it diminishes and becomes difficult to detect. What's more is a few days prior, I've had another weird sensation of being jabbed by a needle under my skin, between my shoulder blades.

So now, I'm having a bit of a dilemma as to whether or not I should get a psychological assessment. I'm eighteen and not financially independent yet, so I will have to rely on my parents to fund any mental healthcare services. I've found this one psychiatric clinic about half an hour away that offers psychological assessment for RM 250 per session (around USD 60+), and my mom said that if I genuinely feel like I have a problem, I should go ahead and make an appointment.

My main reasons for doing so are the above supposed tactile hallucinations, and another feeling that's a bit hard for me to communicate effectively to my therapist. I feel like all my thoughts, emotions, personality traits and even my memories are fake. Every time I feel pain, I'm faking it. Every time I do anything at all, I'm faking it. Even the feeling that everything is being faked, I'm faking it. I feel like ""I"" am forcing myself to feel these things, and that nothing is real or truly exists.

What's more is I've been told I think differently from other people, and it's not always a good thing. While sometimes, some people compliment me on my ""unique"" perspective, most of the time, like in the case of my teachers, people reprimand me for having a ""broken"" or ""wrong"" way of thinking. I don't think I'm unique at all, but when I'm doing schoolwork, I say things that make sense to me, that other people can't understand, even if it's almost identical in my mind to something someone else says afterwards of which they can understand perfectly. This makes it a bit harder for me to communicate my ideas without following a set response style.

Okay, back on the topic of psychological assessment. I'm worried that if I go through with it, I'll find that there's nothing actually wrong with me, and that I'm just a really, really shitty neurotypical, mentally well person, and I'd have wasted my parents' money for nothing. And if the opposite result is obtained, that I'm in need of mental health support, then I'm worried that I'll become a burden to the people around me who do nothing but love and support me. But if I do nothing, I worry that any potential underlying issues will rear its ugly head and cause me to hit the rockiest bottom I've ever fallen into.

What should I do? I really want to be able to function normally, but I don't know if what I'm experiencing is just a normal-person kind of thing or something that requires genuine attention. If anyone could describe their personal experience seeking professional help for psychological issues, that would be great."
Riverrdog,INTP,"Since yesterday, I've noticed that music is slower than usual. It's not that I don't enjoy the music, it just feels abnormally slow compared to how I normally experience things. I also normally pace around the house a lot, but ever since last night, I've been significantly less active, and I've been moving slower than what I'm used to. My brain feels as if it's spinning. It's kinda like the motion sickness type of spinning, but exclusively in my head. I feel so angry and frustrated at everything and everyone and especially myself. I feel like screaming and throwing my furniture, but externally I'm wearing a poker face. The feeling is wearing off right now as I type, but it was quite intense for the past hour or so. I haven't been able to do the work I'm supposed to do. Is this something to be concerned for, or is it just something perfectly normal?

I have no history of chronic physical illnesses, and I have never been diagnosed with any mental illnesses or disorders so far."
Riverrdog,INTP,"18F, no chronic physical/mental illnesses or disorders (that I currently know of), no history of trauma or abuse.

I have this feeling that ebbs and flows every so often where I become completely disconnected from my own thoughts and emotions, to the point where I'm disconnected from even the feeling of disconnection itself. I constantly feel as though I'm faking any pain, or forcing myself to feel certain emotions in order to evoke pity and attention from other people. It's not always distressing, though. Sometimes I don't mind it, but other times, like last night, it frustrates me to the point of tears because I don't feel like a real person, and even that feeling, I feel isn't real.

Aside from feelings, I also feel this way with my eyesight. I feel like I see two images merged as one, rather than one singular image. Up till now I thought I just had shitty eyesight, but that feeling still remains even if I cover one eye and try to see things only with the other. This leads me to believe it may be more psychological than physical, but at the same time I can't confirm because I constantly feel that I've created these false emotions to garner attention and sympathy.

It's frustrating because I'm going for my first therapy session soon, and I fear I won't be able to recount my experiences properly if I constantly feel a gap between myself and myself. Is this normal? Is this something that everyone does? Is this something that's perfectly ordinary that I've somehow deluded myself into making a big deal out of in order to feel special?

Please help."
Riverrdog,INTP,"This is a pretty outlandish theory that's mostly in good fun, but there's a small possibility that FOWL might be spying on the Duck family via Donald. Of course, Donald has no idea about this. 

(Going full Matpat mode lmao.) 

At the end of the Senior Junior Woodchuck episode, the bugged mosquito/robot is shown biting Donald before Gandra reports the status of the Duck family. While this could be a gag on Donald's luck, it could also be Gandra injecting her technology into Donald's bloodstream (the same technology she implants into her own eyes to be able to scan her surroundings).

In the Escape From The Impossibin episode, it is revealed that F. O. W. L. knows all about Scrooge's new security measures. Some have speculated that Fenton gave away information due to his affection for Gandra, which is entirely possible but for the sake of this theory let's focus on our main subject. 

Donald does not seem to fit into this at first glance, but if you remember from the episode where Scrooge gets his money stolen by a time-manipulating Glomgold, Gyro tested the security system of the Money Bin on Donald. Of course, this could be a one-time gag or a ""by the way"" kind of favour, but let's draw our attention to another one of Gyro's technologies that has directly benefitted the Duck family - OxyChew.

OxyChew comes in only one flavour, black liquorice, a flavour that Della is known to hate. However, black liquorice is also said to be Donald's favourite flavour. It's possible that in development stages, Gyro did much of his testing on Donald and made OxyChew black liquorice flavoured in order to somewhat appease Donald's bad temper. Gyro also seems to have many technologies at his disposal whenever Donald is in need of it (i.e., the walkie-talkie earphones in Daisy's debut episode, the Don Cheadle voice box). From this we might assume that owing to Donald and Gyro's proximity, F. O. W. L. deliberately chose to bug Donald. 

Going back to the Impossibin episode, Mrs. Beakley lists Donald among possible suspects for a spy. This is further emphasized by a pan to Donald's reaction, as well as his desperate, failed attempts to erase it. This action *directly* calls attention to his name being on the board. No other suspect has received this amount of emphasis. (Possibly because they weren't there in the room, but let's just go wack with this lol.)

At the end of the episode, Mrs. Beakley realises that they must trust one another and fight as one. This realization is catalysed by Donald standing up for the kids and Webby saving her grandma. The scene ends with the kids saying ""We're family. The one thing we know for sure is that we trust each other... Right?"" Notice how Mrs. Beakley does not respond with a yes or no, instead giving in to a hug by the kids and Donald, which is cut off by an alert of a F. O. W. L. attack. It would be very ironic if this turns out to foreshadow that they *can't* trust one another.

But hey, that's just a theory.

*A Ducktales theory.*"

Riverrdog,INTP,"I'm an East Asian gal and I've found that an overwhelming majority of my crushes on women tend to be black (also South Asian but I won't go into that here ajhshdh). And more specifically, dark-skinned black women. 

I don't meet a lot of black people IRL so these have mostly been over-the-internet crushes so far, but, I just find dark-skinned black women so pretty?? Especially when black women are just being silly and carefree and messing around for the fun of it, their smiles and laughter just kinda stand out to me a lot. My heart races when I think about them. Under the sunset, which paints the sky with a million colours, I find that black women look even more breathtaking, as if the colourful sky was created for the sheer purpose of paling in comparison. Black skintones remind me so much of a warm cup of hot cocoa on a cold, winter's day, and there's just a sense of fuzziness I feel when I look at a black woman that I don't get when I look at, say, a white woman. It was to the point that I doubted my attraction to women at all just because I wasn't all that romantically attracted to white and light-skinned women.

I low-key feel guilty about it because I've heard all sorts of stories of people who fetishise and dehumanise black people and I'm worried that I may be turning into one of them. Should I like,, crush these feelings into the ground or something before it's too late?"
Riverrdog,INTP,"Let me explain: when I was a kid, I played with two stuffed animal puppies. For privacy reasons, I have changed their names, but I shall call them Doggy and Missy for the sake of this post.

Doggy was my oldest friend. They were my partner in crime and I loved making all sorts of scenarios for them. Sometimes they would be a knight in shining armour, other times they would be a fairy princess. Doggy had a bit of an ambiguous design, so I could imagine them as any gender without a problem. When my cousin asked me whether Doggy was a boy or a girl, I told her ""Sometimes Doggy is a he, and sometimes she's a she. Doggy is always Doggy.""

Enter Missy. My grandmother got me Missy when I was about four, as a friend for Doggy. Unfortunately, I was and still am a hopeless romantic sap, so I made Missy Doggy's romantic partner instead. Missy and Doggy were always together, regardless of whether Doggy was a she or he. They would pick out nice dresses for each other, and always had each others' backs. They would rescue each other from evil witches and both of them would rule the world as president and first lady.

This was a bit of a silly story but I just wanted to share the fact that Doggy and Missy think y'all are heckin rad."

Ajelandor,ESTJ,"So, quarentine is being a bitch to all of us. For me, I saw it as an opportunity to develop my body since I have a home gym. So, without social requirements, I thought it was the perfect time for a full 6 day program. 
So, aside for 7days a week of cardio in the ellyptical, I setted a PPLPPL routine for myself, resting on Sundays with abs any other day. First two weeks went awesome but after the third one I was feeling a bit off. So I decided to take a deload week. I went from 6days ppl to 3 days full body, and light yoga on off days. Saturday and Sunday I went for a walk instead of ellyptical since quarantine went lighter in my country. Sunday afternoon I was really rested, ready and excited for starting this week with new energy.
Three days in I feel like shit. Both Monday and Tuesday nights I had a bad time getting to sleep (I work out from 8-9:30 PM and go to bed around 11:30, but couldn't get asleep till 2AM-3AM, even tho I wake up at 7 AM without any alarms). Even tho, I wake up feeling well rested, and have energy during the day. I get pumped for workouts, and I still enjoy them and get good numbers.
But for my body, things are weird. My neck feels stiff, I get aches and my latest pain has been a pinch in my foot (althought I think it's just from walking outdoors for the first time after a month and a half).
My nutrition is in check, no processes food, real ingredients, and consistent macros (40C 30P 30F). Enjoying every meal, 5 times a day, with a pre workout smoothie at 7 and a big nutritious protein packed meal at 10, with a little walking and home chores after it so I don't go to bed feeling full.
So here is the thing. I have every variable in check, I have a balanced workout split, proper nutrition and till this last days, 7-8 hours of sleep, never waking up feeling tired. When strength training, I don't feel underperforming. In fact, is when I feel the best, the neck stiffness goes away and I feel great. After that, I unwind, take a shower, diner and all. But I just go to bed, lay down, and twist around for 3 hours before I get asleep, even tho as I said, I still wake at 7 feeling well rested.
So, WTF? Has anyone had similar experiences? I'm planing on working out today, and if I have the same problem, take the rest of the week off, getting down to maintenance (I started a 10% surplus on Monday),  should I do this, or stop now?
Any advice will be really appreciated, and sorry for the long post"
Ajelandor,ESTJ,"First thing in the morning i take breakfast. The night before I prepare a bowl with 2tbsp of chia Seeds, 2tsp of cocoa powder, 1/2tsp of stevia, vanilla extract and 125grs of Green youghurt. I eat It with nuts and berries. I havent calculated but I think it's around 600 calories. I eat It at 7:45 and by 10:30 my stomach is roaring. I only have 3 meals a day and the next one is at 3pm. The time between 11 and 3 is a nightmare. I've tried drinkimg sugarless sodas and water but it's real hunger, not thirst. I' ve also tries to eat ghe nuts and berries at 11 but if i dont have them at breakfast I""'m already hungry at 9, so I still grave food. Any thoughts or ideas, similar experiences? I'ts a real pain.
FYI from 3PM till 10PM(dinner) I dont have any cravings, hunger usully starts at 9 so i can hold an hour."
Ajelandor,ESTJ,"Started lifting for four months now, i can really feel my body growing. I can add a little wheight every two weeks or so, and im constantly working on form. But I have a big concern regarding my pecs. When they started appearing after the first month ( i have between 16-22% body fat) my right pec looks and feels much bigger. I currently go 3days a week to the gym, and work pecs and tris together. Since i realized this, I ditched barbell press for dumbell press, but I dont feel my left side weaker, in fact, i can squeze some last reps easier with the left arm. Besides pressing i mostly do cable rows, crossing arms un front. I switch the one that goes over the other in each rep but is in this exercise that i feel the most imbalanced. Not in strength but posture. I'm Thinking about changing the leg in front in each set, but I dont know what else to do. Anyone with similar experiences? How did you fix It?"
Ajelandor,ESTJ,"So I recently watched the Elton John biopic ""Rocketman"" and I very much enjoyed it. The songs are beautifuly redone and played, and the audio mixing is amazing. On the start of [the highlight of the movie, the Rocketman song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YiQW50BMdSU), I noticed something I haven't found said on any online forum. The chords and melody played just before the chords of the actual rocketman really sound like the intro of ""Can You Feel The Love Tonight"", from The Lion King movie. Since this movie is from Disney I'm guessing Paramount doesn't even have the rights of this song. Did anybody else noticed this? Anyone has more info on this part of the movie?"
AndyGeeMusic,ESTJ,"Hello friends, I would say that within my friend circle the most common personality type is ENFP.  I find that when I'm coming up with ideas for things to do, it's always the ENFPs who agree and get excited about doing stuff with me.  I love your sense of spontaneous adventure, which forces me to be less rigid and more comfortable dealing with not having a schedule to stick to.  For example, I was on holiday with two friends and the ENFP randomly said ""since we don't have any plans for today, why don't we drive to the northernmost point of the country?"" So we did, and I thoroughly enjoyed the experience.  Over time it has helped me to become more spontaneous and to embrace a bit of uncertainty.

How do you approach event planning when there are other types involved who may not be as relaxed as you are?  Have you found that people's desire to have structure annoys you, or you're quite happy to accommodate their needs simply because you know how much stress it causes them?"
AndyGeeMusic,ESTJ,"Hello folks, I've been recording and producing music for over 7 years now and I feel I am at a stage where I have enough experience to help others with their recording questions.  As singers, we want to be able to record ourselves clearly and with the best quality available so that others can give us the most accurate critique on our voices.  

I've been considering setting up a group call (most likely on Zoom/Discord) where we discuss how you can get the best audio quality from your equipment.  This is primarily aimed at people who don't know much about the recording aspects (what equipment to buy to improve recording quality, how to remove background noise, what software to use for recording etc). The reason for a group call (as opposed to forum posts) is so that we can have a real time discussion about your particular setup where you can ask whatever pops into you head, and I also think it's great to meet people face to face in these lonely lockdown times!

If this is something people would be interested in, please respond here telling me a little about your goals, your recording setup, and what kind of things you'd like to know regarding the technology side of recording.

Kind regards,

Andy"
AndyGeeMusic,ESTJ,"I know that some people like to observe others in social situations, making mental notes in their heads about whether they are extrovert/introverts etc.  Do you always try to type people when you meet them?  Do you ever struggle to type people, and does it ever bother you when you feel like you don't understand them?"
AndyGeeMusic,ESTJ,"Hello friends, I am seeking to improve my self-awareness so this question is for those of you who have become more self-aware over time:

2.Can you give examples of how your behaviour/thought process changed as a result of gaining more self-awareness?

AndyGeeMusic,ESTJ,"Hello folks, I've been mixing for about 5 years now and I think I've become steadily better at it over that time.  I have learned things that I wish I had known when I began (although I am definitely not claiming to be amazing!).  I'd love to help others grow, and so I'm wondering if any of the less experienced artists here would be interested in having their FLP projects constructively critiqued?  I would be putting these on my Youtube channel so that others can also learn, but I really have no idea if this is something people would be interested in.  I think the weekly feedback thread is great but since it doesn't use the FLP itself, it's not actually addressing the thought process behind the music.  I'm looking for the FLP project file rather than simply the track itself is to see HOW you work and the decisions you made to get your sound, and this would also me to make changes and show how those changes affect your track (hopefully for the better!). 

If you're interested in having your project critiqued in this way, please DM me and we can discuss a bit about your musical background and the file(s) you'd like feedback on.

You might be wondering if this is an elaborate scam to steal people's musical ideas, but that's absolutely not my intention and I will not be sending the FLP to anyone else.  Also, apologies in advance to the mods in case this is breaking any rules - my goal here is primarily to help beginners improve their music and workflow, rather than self-promotion.

Kind regards,

Andy"
AndyGeeMusic,ESTJ,"Hello friends, I am a producer from Scotland looking to make cover songs with singers because I would like to expand my portfolio but I'm not a very good singer myself!  I'm looking for one or maybe two people who have a reasonable quality microphone, a reasonable voice, and an open mind.  I play both electric and acoustic guitar in additional to having a collection of virtual instruments so I hope this will enable me to create the backing tracks for the song(s) you choose to cover.  

The workflow would be as follows:

\- You suggest a song that you would like to cover along with the key

\- I create the instrumental backing track

\- You record your vocals using the backing track

\- You send the vocals to me as a .wav file

\- I will mix and master them and you will receive a (hopefully) decent sounding track!

There is no cost involved - we would each get to build our portfolio and gain some experience working with others :)

Please see below some samples of my music, I've given both Soundcloud and Spotify links because I know some folks may not have one or the other.  In both cases I created all the instrumentals.

AndyGeeMusic,ESTJ,"Hello INFJ friends :) I would love to be more understanding and sympathetic towards other people, and I thought the best place to start would be INFJ which is the personality type I have read to be the least compatible with my own.  I have been reading a number of posts here trying to figure out how INFJs think, but have been too scared to post anything because my lack of emotional intelligence and self-awareness may well result in me coming across as incredibly offensive, which is never my intention.

I am actively trying to rectify weaknesses associated with my own personality type, such as being less controlling, listening to the opinions of others, and not looking down on feelers - but while these are positive behavioural changes, they don't actually help me to understand others better.

Would any of you be interested in helping an emotionally inept person like me understand how to think like an INFJ when their mindset is so far from my own?  There is a part of me that worries I will never be able to understand what it is like to be led by feelings rather than logic.

Kind regards,

Andy"
AndyGeeMusic,ESTJ,"Hello friends, I am a Christian songwriter and I have recently started trying to write songs which speak about real struggles such as alcoholism, social media addiction etc.  My goal is to write relatable but encouraging music which discusses these issues but also introduces listeners to Christ as the ultimate solution.  If you have a story about issues you are/were struggling with, and you think that your experiences may be helpful to others going through the same thing, I would love to hear from you.  I realise this sort of thing can be very personal, so I would be communicating via DM and your identity would remain anonymous.

In practice, I would be doing the following:

1.Asking about your experiences to understand how the issue affects people

2.Putting that into lyrics and creating an instrumental

3.Reviewing and refining the lyrics together with you

If anyone is interested, please DM me!  Apologies in advance if this breaks any rules!"
AndyGeeMusic,ESTJ,"I have been writing music since I was a teenager and it made me wonder if we can discern an author's type by their writing style and the topics they address.  Would you expect a sensor to write more about their experiences and what they have seen, and an intuitive to write about abstract ideas?  Are there song examples you can give which would suggest that their author is clearly one or the other?"

Durianpaw,ESTJ,"So time for me to infodump about the most important part of MBTI: cognitive functions 

There are eight cognitive functions, Fe, Te,Fi,Ti,Si,Se,Ni,Ne

Feeling and thinking functions are judging functions, they allow you to make decisions.

Fe stands for extroverted Feeling and is all about making decisions based on communal values and maintaining harmony. Fe is also the ability to recognise social norms and social standards. Fe and Ti are opposites

Te stands for extroverted thinking and it is my dominant function. Extroverted thinking is basically about making decisions on ""what makes sense for everyone"" people high in Te tends to appreciate structure and tend to use objective facts and systems to measure and make decisions. Te and Fi are opposites

Fi stands for introverted Feeling and is about being in touch with your personal values, what you want and your feelings. Honestly not much to say about this one but basically High Fi users go with their heart.

Ti stands for introverted thinking, they are dependent on their logic and like to question things and make decisions on ""does this make sense to me personally?""

And now onto the perceiving functions: sensing and intuition, they decideda how you perceive information from the outside world.

Si stands for introverted sensing, it is all about you perceiving information from your own past experiences and comparing them. High Si users would trust their experiences in the past. The opposite of Si is Ne

Se stands for extroverted sensing, it is about spatial awareness and living ""in the present"". Many high Se users also tend to have a good eye for aesthetics. The opposite of Se is Ni

Ni stands for introverted intuition, it is about your gut feelings and instincts and all about the ""future"". Like its name, high Ni users tend to rely on their gut feeling and often ""realise"" answers, they also tend to notice patterns others don't 

Ne stands for extroverted intuition and is about ideas and being adaptable, high Ne users tend to be spontaneous and more flexible and is often full of ideas. 

Your main function is made up of four functions, dominant, auxiliary, tertiary and inferior. The dominant function is what you rely on the most, basically your second nature. The inferior function is the least developed function in your stack and your inferior function is the function opposite of your dominant (eg, if you have Ne dominant, you have Si inferior)

The auxiliary is a sidekick function that helps with the dominant function, however there are strict rules on what the auxiliary function can be. As it cannot clash with your dominant, it has to be very different for example, if your dominant function is an extroverted function the auxiliary function must be an introverted one vice versa, also if your dominant is an perceiving function your auxiliary must be a judging function and vice versa.

Your tertiary function is your comfort function, and it is the opposite function of your auxiliary (if you have Fe auxiliary you have Ti tertiary)


Heres an alignment of functions and type

INTP- TiNeSiFe
INTJ-NiTeFiSe
INFP-FiNeSiTe
INFJ-NiFeTiSe
ENFP-NeFiTeSi
ENFJ-FeNiSeTi
ENTP-NeTiFeSi
ENTJ-TeNiSeFi
ISFP-FiSeNiTe
ISFJ-SiFeTiNe
ISTP-TiSeNiFe
ISTJ-SiTeFiNe
ESFP-SeFiTeNi
ESFJ-FeSiNeTi
ESTP-SeTiFeNi
ESTJ-TeSiNeFi

As someone stated, heres the reasons you can't flip between types: cognitive functions develop but doesn't change, also j vs p, the j and p changes the entire function stack."
Durianpaw,ESTJ,"Ok I swear im not just some random mbti obsessed NT trying to fake anything idk my impostor syndrome do be hard

Also yes im aware that r/mbti exists but i am just bored ig and like i wanna see someone outside there that actually likes mbti

Anyways hello yalls, I came here wondering if someone have the same special interest but yk what, if the answer's no it makes it more fun. Heres a entire ass introduction to mbti

first of all, theres four letters

i or e
s or n
f or t
j or p

so basically your four letters are determined by your cognitive functions and like

i stand for introverted and e stands for extroverted (beware this only indicates your cognitive intro/extroversion you can still be a e type and be socially introverted)

s stands for sensing and n stands for intuition 

t stands for thinking and F stands for feeling

j stands for judging and p stands for perceiving

fsartori,ESTJ,"Title, basically. Many companies outsource or hire remote workers. Because of the difference in culture, some people may struggle to tolerate or work well with people from other nationalities. Others on the contrary may appreciate this fact and find that they learn more from working in a culturally diverse environment.

I'd like to hear positive anecdotes or stories about people who have experienced this."
fsartori,ESTJ,Just saw this post on a software engineering sub and thought it'd be a good idea to read valuable advice you've received from a manager or a more senior PM.
fsartori,ESTJ,"I am worn out from all the fucking feeling, the not feeling to protect myself, the thinking about my feelings in order to make progress in therapy, the pills cocktail i gotta take every night, the not being able to share with anyone, the fucking lockdown that took everything i love and value from me, the pampering myself as an excuse to buy shit that i dont need, the pigging out to feel good for 10 minutes, and the ever so freaking tiring feeling of being hopeless and abandoned by every single living being on earth. add to the mix tonight's video binge watching of dr k and reckful making me have a meltdown of anguish and empathy.

im so tired... it was a good life why do i have to keep living it. it was great i dont need more. achieved a bunch of goals, was loved, just end it already fuck. everything seems so difficult. i just wanna be like a dog and go away to die far from everyone who loves me so they dont have to suffer"
fsartori,ESTJ,"Hi. The times I've done the test I've got ESTJ and I feel I can relate. But I also feel I can relate in some aspects with ENTPs, so I was wondering why this is.

I like taking Chandler from Friends as an example. It is said that he's ENTP. I can relate to being sarcastic, having my sense of humour and wit be my strongest traits and being sensitive. 

But I do value tradition, I'm decisive, I like being organised. I work as a project manager and I love my job. I value rules and hierarchy. I like being a servant leader or the right hand of a person who I admire. 

I'm also really introspective, very honest... I like making people feel uncomfortable and creating awkward situations just for fun. 

I'm romantic and value expressions of love a lot. Hugs and human interaction in general are very important to me.

Some of my negative traits that friends might say about me have to do with me being difficult. A phrase I've heard about me is ""everything has to be done your way"". This sounds ESTJ to me. But I think humour and wanting to be liked/loved are more important to me than being professional or doing my job right, which to me seems more ENTP.

Lastly I've heard that entps aren't very good at giving advice or comforting someone but I think I am. I've been told I make people feel comfortable in their own skin and I think I'm good at talking about problems or listening. Although I sometimes make the mistake of trying to help people fix the issue instead of just letting them rant/vent. 

I'd love to hear your thoughts. Please let me know if I'm wrong about any of this or if you have any questions."
fsartori,ESTJ,"""As X, I want to do X to achieve X"". That's simple for most requirements. But how do you translate ""I want this button or drawer to be prettier"" or ""Create a prototype of what the app will look like"" to an agile user story?

Or is this part of the definition of ""done""? Maybe the team need to agree on what ""done"" will mean and that's when someone like a designer could say ""this is done once it looks like this""?

Thanks in advance."
fsartori,ESTJ,"Extraño verlos en el Patio Olmos mirando vidrieras o tirados en Parque Las Tejas tomando mate. Extraño escucharlos asombrarse o reir viendo una pelicula juntos en el cine.

Extraño que se saquen fotos en el Buen Pastor y se reunan con sus parejas momentos antes de que empiecen las aguas danzantes. Extraño ir a ver alguna banda y sentir su compañía, avisarle al chofer del colectivo que vienen corriendo para que no arranque, apreciar la onda copada y bohemia con la que se visten cuando van a Guemes...
