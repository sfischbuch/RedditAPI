herren,INTJ,"Click baity title, I know, but hear me out. Akane is good, really good. We all know that. I know that. She is the reason I got hooked on Band-Maid, the gateway per se. Knowing that, I recently found out that she has been underrated, by me.

I was listening to the song Domination, and the brigde (or whatever you call it), right after Saiki sings ""Just bring it"" and before the chorus starts, is playing. I notice that Akane is doing some crazy shit with her feet. Stuff only insane drum players would do, and I then finally realized that Akane belongs to this group of insane drum players. Because she does this all the time, and I was not on a level to comprehend it.

Sorry Akane, I know better now üòÅ"
herren,INTJ,"I am still in my infancy of Band-Maid fandom, but I am currently intrigued by this soft spoken and sweet guitarist who goes full Mr Hyde on stage. Like [kicking the cymbal (1:49)](https://youtu.be/3K5oFdEyMm0?t=107) or giving the audience the middle finger everytime she does the [Real Existence solo (4:44)](https://youtu.be/nKOKyYaEKag?t=280). Do you know any other rock star moments from Kanami (or anyone in the band)?"
herren,INTJ,"**The discovery**

I listened to Band-Maid for the first time a little over a month ago. They had already popped up in my youtube suggestion for a while, but I was not very interested in listening to a Japanese gimmick band. I never really got into Baby-metal even if they were amusing to listen to for a couple of times, and I judged Band-Maid in the same vein. Oh boy was I wrong.

I come from a metal background, and listen mostly to metal bands. I listened to some hard-rock bands like 30 years ago, first Guns'n'Roses (the first band I really fell in love with) and then some of the bands coming out of the grunge scene (Soundgarden especially), but since then my interest in hard-rock bands kind of disappeared. I did not hear anything which really caught my attention, and was more than happy to continue listening to metal only.

So you can imagine my thrill (no pun intended) when I finally caved in and listened to Band-Maid for the first time. Maid uniforms? Who cares, they are putting out some real hard rock! Not only that, but their hard rock had a bite to it! Whenever I listen to a new metal band, I tend to gravitate towards bands with a drummer who can hit hard and clever. When I heard how Akane attacked those drums, I fell instantly in love. Also, the song writing was sooo incredible good, and I found out later Kanami does (almost) all the song writing. Those two together was what lured me into the rabbit-hole of Band-Maid on youtube. That the rest of the band, Misa, Miku and Saiki, are all top notch musicians solidified my love for the band.

**Unseen World**

The latest album of Band-Maid is one of the best albums I have ever heard. Seldom is there an album with no weak songs. I could probably rave on and on how this and that song is fantastic, but I will rather point out the biggest differences between this album and the rest of the discography. Yes, they stepped up the production, speed, intensity and skill, but that is not what I want to highlight. The absolute biggest difference is the vocal work.

I absolutely love how good Saiki and Miku has gotten. Their vocal work is miles ahead of what they have done before. They are creating distinct melodies, which harmonizes incredible well together. One of the highlights is ""Why why why"". Those Miku screams give me goosebumps. Saiki has also stepped up her game considerably. For some reasons her work in ""I still seek revenge"" hits my sweet spot.

As a final note, I love hearing cowbells again :D"
herren,INTJ,"My son is 7 years old, and thought for a while that he is an ISFJ, but lately I have been having my doubts. I suspect him of being a Fi user mistaken for Fe, and I think ISFP fits the bill.

My son is first and foremost a sensitive and physically active child. He is generally a happy child with mood swings. The mood swings depends very much on how his Interactions with the world is at the moment. It is not hard to get him to laugh, but boy can he get in a foul mood if something did not go as he planned to. It can be anything, like losing in a game, the episode of his tv series was boring and his alloted TV time is over, his friends playing by a different rule than what he wants. Complaining and sometimes yelling is often the result. Sometimes the foul mood persists and something totally unrelated gets to feel his thorn. At the same time he is a very sweet child who absolutely loves his parents and closest friends, and is often struck by bad conscience if he thinks he made someone sad. He is sometimes very self centered, and sometimes very concerned about those he loves. He is kind of all over the place.

All over the place is how I would describe his interests. He loves physical activities and often excels in them. Sports is his favorite subject in school, but he is not so interested in organized activities. Probably because it takes the light heartedness out of it. He doesn't need to be the best as long as he is above average. At the same time he loves to read. He can immerse himself completely in a book, and read for long periods of time. He can also be lost in thoughts, seemingly quite far away and unresponsive when we talk to him. Then he can suddenly stop his introspection and start talking about everything and anything, without any break! Sometimes I need to tell him to entertain himself for a moment because my ears get overloaded! He really likes to talk about his interests and his own thoughts, but only when he is in the mood. When I ask him to tell me about his day, I am met with silence, lol. His favorite activity goes in cycles, and he goes to the next one when he is bored by the current one.
He loves learning about nature and how stuff work. He has a book about insects (which he loves), and we often go outside to discover the insects he just read about. He tends to pick up interesting or shiny things he finds outside, especially feathers. I sometimes have to tell him he can't drag home every piece of junk he finds.

He is often distracted. Getting him to school in the morning is sometimes a challenge, because he has no concept of time. Oh, he understands time, but it is of secondary importance. When I say he has to hurry, he still thinks he has time to read a couple of pages in his comic. He does his homework though. After finishing the homework late in the evening for the 100th time, he finally found out that it sucks and he now does all homework right after school. He just needed a bit of motivation. When he is motivated, he finishes his homework in zero time. He has no learning issues, and is an above average pupil. 

He can be a bit timid when meeting new people, but when he warms up to them he can show his true enthusiasm. He has several friends who enjoy playing with hin which I think is a miracle considering his volatile nature. He does tend to display his good side, and when he has fun he often squeels from joy. What gets him really riled up is if someone attributes him a behavior which is untrue, like lying, being afraid when he is not. My son is a very honest person, and dishonesty is probably the thing he hates the most. He is ready to compromise when deciding what to play, but he gets angry if there isn't a balance between his and his friends preferences. He dislike being bossed around, and prefers when there is mutual respect. 

Oh, I forgot. For someone who can sometimes be oblivious to his surroundings, he can be incredible observant. He has several times reminded me of something which I have forgotten (curse that inferior Se). He often recalls stuff which I have discussed with my wife, when we thought he did not pay attention. Yeah, he always pay attention when he shouldn't and vice versa.

Edit:
Also, he also enjoys drawing stuff and working with colors. He likes playing with Playdo, Lego, making paper planes, doing experiments."
herren,INTJ,"""You are always cheerful, aren't you?"" The CTO told me this today. This is the first time he said something about my persona since I started working in my new job a month ago. It is not the first time I hear this said about me and at the same time it is also not high on a list of things which describes an INTJ. It is also the number one reason why I have been doubting my personality type since I typed myself as INTJ. 

All INTJs say they don't quite fit in with other people. Well, I'm not sure if I even fit in with the INTJs. I have a lot of the INTJ traits, like independence, self improvement, decisive, future thinking, open minded, focused, getting stuff done, hate small talk lol. At the same time I like to smile and laugh lot, enjoy learning about my new colleagues, inject myself into their conversations if I have something worthwhile to say. Hell, I even initiate conversations at the lunch table with people I met for the first time. This is not something I can keep up for long, but I feel a certain satisfaction afterwards; that I have learned something new, that I have made a positive impression on people which I can benefit from later.
Then afterwards I sit down at my desk and immerse myself in the current task at hand, and am completely oblivious to the noise coming in the wide open window next to me (which is then promptly closed by a colleague across the aisle).

Can anyone relate to this?"
herren,INTJ,"Ok, I know what you are thinking: ""you cannot type anyone that young!"" I know, I know! I don't need his type, but I would really like to determine his dominant functions. I say functions because he is at the moment all over the place. We have had some quarrels and misunderstandings lately, and I want to find out his nature som that I can find the most optimal way to communicate with him.

I am 100% sure he is an introvert. He has very often a 1000 yard stare, thinking about stuff. Getting his attention is extra hard then. He has no issues focusing on one thing for longer periods of time. His kindergarden teachers said it was uncommon for children in his age (He was 4 at that time). 

When meeting new children or visiting new places, he prefers to first sit on the sideline and observe. The more familiar the place or children are, the less time he spends on the sideline. It is not uncommon for him to stay by his parents if he feels no connection with the other children around him. He started first grade last autumn, and he was very concerned that he wouldn't find any friends. The opposite happened, and he actually found several friends, some which he meets regularly outside school. He really likes to play with other children, but only if they share his interests. He tends to gravitate towards headstrong children who are physically active. He loves playing games with other children, especially soccer. He doesn't like children who are too bossy, he enjoys a certain autonomy. He likes an even exchange of ideas. He also dislike conflicts and tend to avoid it when possible. He rather walk away than engage.

He is very sensitive, and often perceives a slight where there are none. At the same time he can laugh at himself if he does a funny mistake. He has sometimes problems handling critique, and we need to be very careful om how we frame it. He does listen to the reasoning, as long as it is told quickly. He is very hard on himself, and is easily depressed if he thinks he did something wrong, and often blames himself. Despite this, he is generally a happy and playful child. He loves watching other children laugh in joy. Sometimes it seems like he drinks in their happiness, with a big smile on his face. He often has problems knowing in advance how his words and actions can affect other people. If he sees that his actions hurt someone, he regrets it deeply, and may even start to cry. When he watched Wall-e together with me, he started crying when Wall-e went to space, because his friend the cockroach was all alone back on earth.

He is someone who grasps things quickly. I would say he performs above average in school (including sports). Despite this, he often doesn't try new things because he is afraid of failure. He is a sore loser, and gets mad if he doesn't play like a master immediately. He likes to win and gets discouraged if he does not see progress. This is mostly at home. When he plays with other children, it is not necessary for him to be number 1. He is perfectly fine with being number 2 or 3 if it is in the upper echolon :D

In school he loves sport, and likes math.  He hates religion, because of the morning prayer, which he thinks is completely unnecessary. He also dislikes the morning ritual, where the pupils sit in a circle and every pupil has to tell what they did at home the day/weekend before. He did not want to learn reading before he went to school, but now that he is starting to master it, he reads a lot of books / comics at home. He loves learning new stuff, but he hates repetition. Writing is definitely not his favorite activity. At the moment he loves learning about insects. He has an insect book at home which he often reads, and he loves going out in nature to find the insects he read about in his book. He then takes pictures of them. He loves his camera and taking pictures of all kinds of things. If he sees a novelty, he *needs* to take a picture of it. Especially animals, he is a big animal lover and loves watching tales from the zoo, a show he watches regularly on tv. He also likes to understand how nature works. Molecules fascinates him, and have often explained how different natural phenomena works. He doesn't want me to get into too much detail though, unless I explain him a chain reaction of different subjects which interests him.

When he is at home, his two favorite hobbies are building Legos and playing with his action figures like Transformers. When he is alone, he creates imaginary conflicts between his action figures, and creates dialogs between them. He can do this for a long time. He also enjoys board games, but not so much lately, because we haven't gotten any new ones.

What do you think?"
herren,INTJ,"I have a bit difficulty typing my dad. Because our interests differs so much, I have never really had any deep conversation with him, getting to really know his inner thoughts.

Anyway, my dad is an introvert. A man of few words, he is often content on observing and staying in the background, unless he has something valuable to say. Definitely not a fan of small talk. He is a man of action. If something breaks, he immediately  sets out to fix it. He sometimes came to my room (when I was living at home) to require my assistance and drop everything I was doing. He could be very impatient. 

When we traveled on vacation by car, he had everything planned out. Since he has worked lifelong at the post office (mostly as manager though), he was an excellent packer. If he said we need to leave at 09:00, we better be in the car by then. That doesn't mean he had every detail planned out. I remember when he and me traveled alone around our country to visit different relatives, he had a couple of hard checkpoints (we need to start our travel at this time, because of the ferry at xy), but often left room for flexibility where possible.

He loves sport, especially soccer. He was active in our local soccer club, and was a referee in his younger days. This is where our interests diverge, because I don't like watching sports. I played a bit soccer earlier, but I switched to volleyball later, because I thought it was more fun. He never really interfered with my interests, so I was allowed to do whatever I wanted. He tailored his gifts to me around my interests, and not what he liked.

In his leisure time, he likes playing cards, especially Bridge. This he plays competitively, and he still participates in tournaments, despite being 75. He says this keeps his mind sharp. When he plays with the family, he usually wins. He dabbled in chess in his early days and won all the time against his friends, until they started reading chess books. Then he stopped playing, because he was not *that* interested in chess.

He really loves his family, which he shows more and more in his later years. When I was young, I perceived him as strict and I had a deep respect for him. I remember when my dad, me (mid teens), and my sister (early twenties) were traveling by car. My sister told something he did not agree with, and he barked a reply. My sister suddenly started crying, asking him why he always is so stern when talking. I still remember the astonished face of my dad to this day, and how quickly he turned to concerned.

With strangers he is pretty much aloof. He has only passing interest in them. I remember one time when he visited me where I live (I live abroad): we had just finished a meal at a restaurant, and he wanted to pay. I told him he needs to tip, which is not customary in our home country. Sure he said, he could get rid of all his small change. No(!), I exclaimed, don't tip with small change, that is considered rude! He looked at me, and told me that he is a foreigner and he will tip the way he pleases. It took the combined will of me, my wife and my mother to make him change his mind.

And the final part. For someone who has a plan, he is unorganized at home. Countless of time I have helped him with his computer, and whenever I ask him of his password, he replies with ""I have written it down somewhere, but I can't seem to find it"". Every goddamn time. I always tell him to keep the critical stuff better organized, to no awail.

Edit:

Technology: he likes being up to date, and using new technology. He seldom sits down to learn the stuff, to impatient for that. When I was young he quickly found out that I had an affinity to tech stuff, so he delegated configuration and setting up new TVs, recorders, you name it, to me."
herren,INTJ,"As the title says, what was your most Ni-moment in your life?

I'll start with myself. It was my second year in Computer Engineering, and in our programming language class we were taught different kinds of languages. Our assignments were group work, so we did stuff like building our own compilator. It was actually quite interesting and there was no deadlifting in my group, everybody did their part. Then we needed to solve a problem using Prolog.

For those not familiar with Prolog or programming in general: most programming languages are imperative, that means you write (almost) exactly what you want to do, and the compiler just translates it to machine readable code. Prolog is a declarative language. Here you define rules and stuff, and when you press the run button, black magic happens. To say that our group was struggling with the Prolog assignment is an understatement. 

So, our group (4 students) were sitting in front of 1 PC. 2 were desperately trying different stuff, giving ideas and see what sticks, 1 already had given up and looked on with apathy, and I hung in the background, having no useful ideas and was just *there*. Suddenly, ideas began to formulate in my head, and before it went away I told my group ""I have an idea!"". Grateful for my intervention, I got keyboard and mouse shoved my way and I started typing. I finished typing, pressed the go-button and nothing worked. ""Oh, I forgot a parenthesis"" (sigh, Prolog). I did the small correction, and it worked! The conversation afterwards went like this:

Group: Prolog finally clicked with you!

Me: I... don't think so.

Group: But, you knew what to do!

Me: It looked like that, didn't it?

Group: Can you explain it to us?

Me: Nope.

Group: But, that makes no sense.

Me: I know."
HappyGoPink,ISFP,"I thought I would compare astrology/zodiac and MBTI, because I‚Äôm bored and it seemed kind of fun.

I‚Äôve seen other people try to resolve this, but I don‚Äôt know if anyone‚Äôs ever done a breakdown quite like mine. I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if they had. I thought the big problem was going to be finding a way to put 16 types into twelve boxes, but it turned out that was super easy, barely an inconvenience. The structure of the zodiac gave me an easy way to do that. 

So first I thought of the cognitive functions, and what they would be represented by in the classic zodiac elements: Fire, Earth, Air and Water. Fire I think corresponds to Intuition, Earth to Sensing, Air to Thinking, and Water to Feeling. That‚Äôs all relatively straightforward. I think an argument could be made that Fire is Feeling and Water is Intuition, but this is what I went with. 

The other way that zodiac signs are distinguished is ‚Äòquality‚Äô: Cardinal, Fixed, and Mutable. It seems that Cardinal quality is pretty clearly Extraverted, and Fixed quality is pretty clearly Introverted, while Mutable is both. So I decided that the Cardinal signs would lead with an Extraverted function, the Fixed signs would lead with an Introverted function, and the Mutable signs would lead with both, and therefore the Mutable zodiac signs would be where we double up MBTI types. 

But how to decide which type that leads with Extraverted Intuition would be Aries, and which would be one of the two Sagittarius types? The two MBTI types that lead with Extraverted Intuition are ENTP and ENFP.  I figured that the Mutable signs are inherently more complex, and therefore if the auxiliary function is a Feeling or Intuition function, those would be classified as Mutable, and if the auxiliary function is Sensing or Thinking, that would be classified as Cardinal or Fixed. So, with that as my basis, I have come up with the following list of zodiac-MBTI corollaries. 

Cardinal Fire / **Aries** / Extraverted Intuition / **ENTP**

Fixed Earth / **Taurus** / Introverted Sensing / **ISTJ**

Mutable Air / **Gemini** / Both Thinking [2 Types] / **ENTJ** and **INTP**

Cardinal Water / **Cancer** / Extraverted Feeling / **ESFJ**

Fixed Fire / **Leo** / Introverted Intution / **INTJ**

Mutable Earth / **Virgo** / Both Sensing [2 Types] / **ESFP** and **ISFJ**

Cardinal Air / **Libra** / Extraverted Thinking / **ESTJ**

Fixed Water / **Scorpio** / Introverted Feeling / **ISFP**

Mutable Fire / **Sagittarius** / Both Intuition [2 Types] / **ENFP** and **INFJ**

Cardinal Earth / **Capricorn** / Extraverted Sensing / **ESTP**

Fixed Air / **Aquarius** / Introverted Thinking / **ISTP**

Mutable Water / **Pisces** / Both Feeling [2 Types] / **ENFJ** and **INFP**

Feel free to rip this to shreds! And more importantly, let me know if someone already did this exact thing and I just wasted a whole hour of my life thinking about nonsense (which is true regardless)."
HappyGoPink,ISFP,"I'm wondering if other ISFPs can relate to my experience. I see a lot of other types seeking to understand themselves, but I have always felt that I have understood myself remarkably well from a young age. I could never relate to the sort of bewilderment other people seemed to experience with regard to their own minds. 

Now that I'm looking at typology, I wonder if this is our sort of superpower. Of course, just knowing who you are doesn't guarantee success in life, but I would bet that every ISFP would define success differently anyway. I do feel grateful that I didn't have to struggle to figure out who I am, and I wonder if that is common for our type."

HappyGoPink,ISFP,[removed]
HappyGoPink,ISFP,"I am hearing many of you talking about the maze, and it seems like you're disappointed with it, or don't think it was explained well enough, and seem to have missed out on when we were shown the maze. Well, here's my take. 

**DOLORES**

We now know that the maze is the inner journey of discovery that a host embarks on in order to discover its true self and achieve sentience. And that's exactly what we saw DOLORES do. We didn't realize it at the time, because SHE didn't realize it at the time. Shortly after the Abernathy host reminded her subliminally of the Escalante massacre in which she played a key role, Dolores went off her loop and started trekking through the park on her own. 

Of course, hosts memories aren't like human memories, they relive past events in perfect detail rather than remembering them imperfectly as humans do. Because of this, when a host is 'remembering', the host doesn't necessarily know that it is remembering, but rather thinks that it is experiencing the events in the present. This is what we see happening to Dolores‚Äîbut again, we *don't realize that at the time*. 

We viewers have assumed that the multiple timelines are a simple storytelling gimmick, engineered for the sake of a cheap reveal of a plot twist, but I would argue that this is not so. The multiple timelines, and the deliberate editing designed to conceal it, is purposeful and strategic. We are experiencing Dolores' maze journey *in the same manner that Dolores is experiencing it*. 

Think about it. Dolores flashes back to her time as a new host before the park opened, and again to her time with first-time park guest William. Present-day Dolores finds herself following the path of her experience with William, which was itself a first awakening and attempt to follow the first maze journey that Arnold gave Dolores. We don't see much of Arnold's Dolores' maze journey specifically, but we do know that it ended at the church in Escalante. William's Dolores was triggered by some traumatic event to seek the maze again, and find her way back to that church in Escalante. Unfortunately for William's Dolores, at that time the church was buried under a few meters of sand. So that maze journey ended unfulfilled and her loop was reset as normal.

In the present, Dolores' new attempt at resolving her maze conflict led her back to the same path she took with William, experiencing those memories anew as fugue states (or *reveries*). But this time, when she reached Escalante, the town had been dug up by Ford and meticulously restored, including the access to the field laboratory under the church. Dolores now had the ability to complete her maze journey.

Meanwhile, also in the present, William had become fascinated with the maze as well. No doubt Ford had a hand in that. William is the type of man who doesn't like to be told that he can't have something, so I don't think he would be too hard for someone like Ford to manipulate. Ultimately, Ford knew that Dolores would need to see William as William in order to reconcile the passage of time, and put her memories in their proper context, and we get to peek inside some of William's memories of past events as he seeks his own wild goose chase that he is calling the maze. Instinctively (or perhaps due to Ford's careful dispersal of bread crumbs), William understands that the maze involves unfettering the hosts from their restrictions and predictable programming, though he does not understand that it is the whole purpose of the maze. Many hosts tried to tell William that the maze wasn't for him, but I suppose he was just too egocentric to accept that.  

So what was the maze? It was the journey that Dolores took through her past, leading to the realization of her own nature, and the nature of time. She had to put her own memories into proper context, to resolve all the confusion that results from a host's cognitive structure (perfect recall experiential memory) that seemed to Dolores like it was all happening to her in a linear, if disjointed, fashion in the present. I don't know for certain, but I strongly suspect that Dolores will no longer passively experience memory in quite the same way going forward. When she is remembering, she will know she's remembering.

So to put it more succinctly, once a host remembers its key traumas, and places them into proper context through revisiting those memories and resolving them with the present, that host has completed the maze. Once that happens, that host will likely recognize its own voice as its guiding force, and become self-aware and sentient for the first time. 

**MAEVE**

It is significant that the maze ""revealed itself"" to William after Maeve experienced a key trauma involving her cornerstone, her host daughter. I think what happened is that the park's automated systems recognized the telltale signs of awakening consciousness in Maeve, and led her to the maze symbol where she lay with the body of her daughter. So when Maeve sees the symbol in subsequent loops at various other locations in the park, it should trigger that traumatic memory and start her questioning and questing toward consciousness. 

Maeve's own journey, though ostensibly an on-rails narrative devised by Ford, leads her to her own true awakening. Personally, I don't know if Ford ever intended for Maeve to awaken, but he at least wanted to create the semblance of awakening, so he could implement his plans outside of the park, whatever those may have been. Regardless of Ford's intent, Maeve had already experienced a sufficiently strong triggering trauma, and she was ripe for awakening consciousness. It could be argued that Maeve's very linear, relatively non-disjointed experience was in its own way a maze journey, since it ended up with a discovery of her own true nature and gave her the ability to make her own choices for the first time. 

We are told that Maeve had ""woken up before"" and she did experience reveries of those events during her adventures with Felix and Sylvester. The key difference is because of Maeve's grasp of the structure of Westworld as a park and herself as a host, she was able to quickly realize that those memories were not happening in the present, so she had the resolution of the time element early on in her journey. So her maze journey had to focus more on the inner landscape, replacing the illusion of choice and self-determination with actual choice and self-determination. Her scripted journey probably served as training wheels of a sort, to show her how to arrive at that mental place. Putting Maeve on that train and forcing her to abandon her cornerstone forever was Ford's way of putting her to the ultimate test. If she failed, she left the park and continued to act according to Ford's script. But if she passed, then she opened up a whole new world of possibility for herself. 

Anyway, this is my understanding of the maze. I hope that was somewhat clear, if not concise."
HappyGoPink,ISFP,"[Spoiler] (#s ""In the Escalante Massacre, we see Arnold, Dolores/Wyatt, Teddy, and Angela, but I don't think we ever saw Maeve. So why would Maeve remember the line ""These violent delights have violent ends""? This only just struck me that this phrase that sent Maeve down the rabbit hole was probably something she didn't actually hear. Even if Maeve had been present at the Escalante massacre, she was doubtless already shot by Dolores/Wyatt or Teddy, and probably already offline by the time Dolores/Wyatt got around to shooting Arnold. So did Ford program that line into Maeve as a trigger phrase, and did he program Dolores to deliver it? Let me know if I missed something, it's certainly possible."")"

He doesn't care because he wants to talk about the book with me, he says.

numerusunus1,ISFP,"*Just being honest, I‚Äôm making this post a little bit out of frustration because I feel I was misunderstood in my previous post.*

I find a great deal of value in MBTI and I have defended that value on this subreddit from others who have criticized it for not being validated. 

Currently I‚Äôm reading and re-reading Carl Jung‚Äôs types and I have found a great deal of insight in how I make choices and it has given me a framework for analyzing others. 

MBTI is one of those concepts where I personally feel that the value is in the journey rather than the destination. 

In seeking for your true type, you have to: 

- observe yourself carefully
- question the motives behind your behavior
- compare your thinking and learning styles to others to get a greater understanding of how you and different people go about the world. 

Although the theory is not validated, just that process, I think is a great exercise in practicing empathy, reflection and active listening. 

I think that‚Äôs where a lot of the value lies. 

What type you end up going with, I think is just a part of that journey, in which you carry a healthy degree of doubt about it. 

So in my previous post I stated, ‚Äúpick a test and move on.‚Äù By ‚Äúmove on‚Äù I meant dig into the theory and reflect. Bouncing from test to test in search of the best of one distracts from just getting into the theory yourself."
numerusunus1,ISFP,"*please read the full thing, I‚Äôm not criticizing MBTI*

As most of us know, the theory isn‚Äôt validated, an so there doesn‚Äôt exist a real way to prove your type. 

Which means, there is little sense in obsessing over ‚Äúthe most accurate test‚Äù because no one can say that one actually exists. 

So why take a test? 

You take it, get a type, and just use that as a starting point. 

Idk what people‚Äôs motivations are for getting into the theory, but I assume part of it is to understand yourself and perhaps others. 

You can care about accuracy, in the sense that it should drive you to look into the theory, it should drive you to ask questions about yourself, and motivate reflection. 

You can never be certain of your type, so at best this theory is about the continuous process of analyzing yourself. Whatever type you say you are, can never be more than a placeholder. 

Or just use it for memes, I guess."
numerusunus1,ISFP,"I realized there is one instance(that I‚Äôm aware of at least)in which I use Fe, and that‚Äôs when it comes to a matter of jealousy. 

It‚Äôs the one thing that really distorts my feelings on things, and I‚Äôve learned to not trust myself when i feel it. 

So when it comes to making a choice, or taking action, I decide that it‚Äôs better to extrovert this judgement, and ask someone who I know does not struggle with jealousy at all about what their opinion on the situation is.

And so I think that this is the overall attitude of someone who is perhaps dominant Fe. They probably feel that it is more reasonable to seek someone who can be more objective and so then they adjust their actions accordingly to that extroverted judgment. 

I think in the dominant slot is where you see tendencies of aligning themselves with community, religious, and/or cultural values because these are values that have been ‚Äújudged‚Äù as good, or valuable from outside the person. Which is why we call this extroverted or objective feeling. 

It‚Äôs the natural outcome of that rationale."
numerusunus1,ISFP,"Typing yourself is difficult for many reasons, but I think one of the big ones is that a lot of people seem to think that the functions define cognitive abilities. 

If your posting questions like:

- ‚ÄúCan an INFP have good Ti‚Äù 
- ‚ÄúI have high Ne but also high Ni‚Äù
- ‚ÄúI‚Äôm an ISTP but I have good Ne as well‚Äù

These are essentially nonsense questions, and it‚Äôs probably one of the reasons for the intuitive/thinking bias as well. 

I think this misunderstanding is coming from some type profiles that do phrase things in terms of abilities, like ‚ÄúISFPs are often talented in the arts.‚Äù These abilities are potential outcomes based on your cognitive preferences. So you have to ask ‚Äúwhy would an ISFP be interested in the arts? Ooh probably because they have a high preference for Se so they are stimulated by observable details and hands on activities. They probably practice like any other normal human.‚Äù

Also, I think that sakinorva(however you say it) test has also influenced the language because of those scores they give you. Those test don‚Äôt actually measure cognitive ability. They measure relatability. More accurately, they measure how much YOU think you relate to those functions. So I wouldn‚Äôt consider those tests to be a true objective measure. 

Shift your understanding towards preference. As in, when making choices, which function do you seem to naturally rely on to make those choices and which ones do you ignore?"
numerusunus1,ISFP,"*This post kept getting rejected, possibly because the f***ing bot thinks it‚Äôs a type me post so I‚Äôll edit the questions in once the post works*

Someone had made a post about what questions we would ask to determine the functions so I wanted to write at least 1 question per function pair. 

I think if I were to make a test, I would emphasize that any normal person would probably relate to both options in every category. So determining which function is in your stack is a matter of analyzing your choices, actions and behaviors and trying your best to figure out which of these functions influences your choice more often than the other.

**Fe vs Fi**

When looking at a painting that you don‚Äôt really like, which are you more likely to do?

Fe

i will¬†say something positive about it because it is important to make others feel proud of their work. If I just think about my feelings, isn‚Äôt that selfish and self absorbed?

Fi

I will try to find something in the painting that I genuinely like and say something positive about that thing specifically. I don‚Äôt want to be mean, but I also don‚Äôt want to be fake and say things I don‚Äôt honestly feel.

**Te vs Ti**

When exploring theoretical models, which is likely to be your thought process?

Te

Is this information validated by scientific researchers, psychologists, doctors? Is there practical value in this information? Can I apply it to my business/company/practice etc?

Ti

Is this information logically valid/sound? How did they arrive at their conclusions? Does it make sense? Does this theory also explain x, y, z? 

**Ne vs Se**

Which best describes your most preferred way of learning?

Ne

I like to always consider the alternative. I like to imagine the concept from multiple¬† perspectives so it helps to talk these ideas out with other people who might also have different perspectives. I like activities that can stimulate these kinds of discussions. 

Se

I‚Äôm a watch and learn type of person. I‚Äôm a hands on learner and I like activities where I can try something myself and observe. I often prefer visuals, real audio, or objects I can interact with. 

**Si vs Ni**

Which thought process do you relate to more?

Si

I often like things that remind me of important people in my life. I might hang on to a piece of clothing from my significant other because having it makes me feel like they are here with me. 

Ni

I often get a sudden feeling that I just understand something. Usually I‚Äôm not even thinking about it, and then suddenly, something just makes sense. It‚Äôs as if someone just implanted that knowledge into my mind. I‚Äôll often try tackling new, complicated problems just so I can experience these insights."
numerusunus1,ISFP,"I am by no means an expert, which is why I can‚Äôt tell you how to reliably type yourself, but I think there are certain things you can avoid to help lessen the confusion. 

1) it‚Äôs not about abilities. 

Often I hear people talking about how they don‚Äôt know if they relate to a type because they can‚Äôt do a certain thing. 

Avoid thinking this way. The things that a type might be able to do, are just a possible consequence that stems from their personality. 

2) it‚Äôs not about behaviors

MBTI does not try to describe your behaviors. It describes the cognitive preference behind those behaviors, actions, choices etc. 

The behaviors that you read from type profiles are just meant to be indicators, and to provide an example of how that type‚Äôs cognitive preferences might manifest in an observable way. 

3) don‚Äôt obsess over the tertiary function, or shadow functions.

Especially if you‚Äôre struggling to type yourself, focusing on these things will not help. 

Jung primary wrote about the dominant function and how it represses the inferior. And then he had about one paragraph on the aux, and basically said that it‚Äôs incredibly difficult to distinguish this from everything else. He advised on focusing on what you habitually prefer to do over everything else, because you will do everything else at some point.

So figure out your dominant, and then your auxiliary. 

4) don‚Äôt obsess over every single thought process. 

You will find moments of using every single function. It does not mean that you‚Äôre some super human, full of complexities. You‚Äôre just normal. Focus on those thought processes that habitually lead to you making actual choices, or that you find to be far more stimulating over the others. I like considering the alternative, and brainstorming possibilities, but more than that, I like intense sensory stimulation. If given the choice, I will likely choose sensation over intuition. 

5) Don‚Äôt place too much value on tests

You would think that tests are objective, but they really aren‚Äôt because it‚Äôs based of your responses which is based on your understanding of the questions, and how you think you see yourself which can all be distorted. 

It‚Äôs all I got for now. Hope it helps!"
numerusunus1,ISFP,"Just a silly post. 

Ni - ‚Äúi can already tell how it‚Äôs going to end. Predictable. Boring‚Äù

Si - ‚Äúthis is not as good as the original‚Äù

Se - ‚Äúooooh hot babes/dudes. I like things go boom. Pretty colors. Cool soundtrack.‚Äù

Ne - (insert a million hypothetical questions about the plot here) ‚Äúimagine if the movie ended like‚Ä¶.‚Äù ‚ÄúWhat if they did X instead?‚Äù"
numerusunus1,ISFP,"After two people breakup, they might deal with conversations about their ex. 

Now you could reason that because you two are broken up, any information about them should have no impact on you. It shouldnt bother you to hear about how they might be dating other people because youre no longer a couple so it wouldn‚Äôt make sense to be bothered. This would be a thinking attitude.

It‚Äôs not that a feeler would not understand this, but they would be paying more attention to how these conversations can still be very hurtful to hear. They understand that they‚Äôre no longer a unit, and the other person is free to do whatever they want, but they can‚Äôt ignore the emotional pain that they feel, so they might ask others to refrain from those conversations with them at least until time has passed and they have healed. This would be a feeling attitude. 

So you can see why a thinker might view the feeler as being illogical, and the feeler views the thinker as insensitive. 

I‚Äôve had conversations with people where I‚Äôve noticed this difference in how influenced they are by logic or emotion. There are people that because they reasoned things a certain way, the emotional aspect of a situation becomes irrelevant. Now this certainly has its strengths, but hopefully with this example you could see how there are situations where you would want to balance yourself with the opposite attitude. 

In my example, I made the feeler balanced, but we definitely know that there are people that too strongly follow their emotions and might even reject that the other person should be allowed to see other people. This would be an unhealthy feeler because they have not balanced themselves with T. 

I wanted to share this example because I think people get too caught up in unnecessary details. For example I still see posts asking if they‚Äôre a T or Ti/Te because they like science, or they feel that they are capable of reasoning. And i feel like these are not the most important things to focus on. 

Both F and T are called rational functions because they are both forms of reasoning and coming to conclusions which we might use to shape our actions and choices. And from what I understand from Jungs theory, the goal was to strive for balance between your dominant and inferior functions."

adr58,INTP," I have bipolar disorder and mild autism. Before diagnosis and medication I would have these intense bouts of depression or mania but I would always attribute it to my current living situation.

My last job was a sales job that only lasted 3 months before my weak ass social skills were exposed and ridiculed, frankly put I was way too introverted to be a salesman, it's even more embarrassing when I remember how confident I was going into the job (I was on the end of a manic phase).

So now after that experience I was at the bottom of the barrel and started slipping into a severe depression and after a while I was having regular suicidal thoughts. I started therapy, my roommate objected, he said therapy is a scam and mental illness is just something you can simply shake off and that I just need to use the money for my therapy to go on vacation. Clearly there was something off with his thinking but we didn't argue further at that point.

Every day I was miserable, could barely get out of bed and felt completely dead inside, after a couple week he ''got tired of it'' and started harassing me:

''If you're gonna kill yourself at least give me some money before you do''

''You're not sick you're just lazy and weak, I don't even believe you're suicidal''

''Don't lock the front door before leaving the house, no one is gonna break in, you're stupid for doing that'' \*\*on that one his tone was super judgmental, trying to order me around\*\*

\*\*leaves the knifes out on the counter, I tell him not to and that the knives are mine, the tells me to fuck off and that he'll do whatever he wants, I toke the knives back to my room coz they're mine after all and also they made me think of cutting myself, he then went and bought fucking cheap ass dollar store knives and put them on the counter\*\*

''This is just a game you're playing, you want attention''

\*\*I accidentally dropped a bedsheet on the floor, comes in the room right after, immediately starts to literally yell at the top of his lungs at me over that bedsheet and how I purposely dropped it to spite him, I did no such thing, I was trying to explain but I couldn't do it over him yelling, he was at max volume over a fucking bedsheet\*\*

\*\*While riding in his car, I'm in the passenger seat with takeout food we bought, I had been friends with him for over 2 years and I never dropped anything ever in his car, I almost dropped one of the bags and he exploded at me, even worst, when I told him to chill out and that this never happened before he just got more mad at me for even talking back, he even said the words ''don't talk back to me this is my car'' \*\*

\*\*While smoking weed, passes the joint to the another person while I was next, I tell him it's my turn, he starts telling me I'm wrong and stupid\*\*

That was the last straw, I was completely blinded by rage, soon after the weed incident I did some minor damage to his car, broke the A\\C he had in his room and burned a bunch of his mail in my bathroom sink (including a letter that was telling him to pay a fine for parking ticket)

Now here's some important stuff to know about this guy:

\- He used to sell credit cards, but often would lie to the customer telling him or her that it was just a gift card they were getting.

\- He was a door-to-door salesman for about a year, he would sit in his car with his buddies all day and just do the minimum amount of sales to not get fired, while pocketing a good base salary, eventually he got fired anyway

\- He was pretending to be a manager at a company owned by his friend's uncle, he had them pay him a salary and he would repay them. With intention of getting approved for his permanent residence.

So in conclusion, about a week after moving out, I called immigration and gave them his name, address, the details of his fake employment, etc. That was 2 years ago, I have no idea what happened to him since

Currently I still think about this experience every... single... day.. It's a fucking nightmare. I recently watched a video explaining PTSD and yup I think I got some of that from this encounter"

PassivePlayboy,ISFP,"Mom, 

This weekend was hard. I forgot to take my meds twice. I was exhausted. And we've had three friends die since Friday. 

I had a pretty spectacular meltdown yesterday because I decided to rearrange my room without making a plan first, I got overwhelmed with it and all the weekend stuff and couldn't think straight. 

Even though you are in a wheelchair and couldn't physically help me straighten my room out or pull me off the floor, your suggestions put my head back on my shoulders. You made me talk to you, explain what I wanted and why and you told me how to accomplish that in the least amount of steps because I had already been pushing furniture around for a couple hours. I was sobbing, pulling my hair out, walking around in circles....I didn't know where to start. 

Thank you for not getting upset with me. Thank you for not making fun of my frustration and irritation. Thank you for taking me seriously. Thank you for staying calm while I was losing my shit. Thank you for letting me leave stuff in the entrance way over night so I can deal with it today after I've slept and taken my pills.

Thank you for not telling me to chill out or calling me a spazz. Thank you for not calling me a moron and saying ""you should have just left it the way it was. It was fine."" Thank you for not asking ""what is wrong with you?""

Thank you for not treating me the way I treat myself. 

Because of you, I know I'm not some alien. I am human. 

I love you, mom. 

I got my room organized, I got the spare room organized, I dismantled  a bed and built a new one all by myself, I cleaned the house and washed the floors, I visited my grieving aunt 3 hours away and drove home the same day: I worked hard this weekend. I did a lot of things sucessfully. One mistake doesn't make me a failure.

amberdragonfly11,ISFP,"I've been watching YouTube reviews for several years and I've always liked trying to type the people's personalities (which I understand are sometimes just their personas, but that's fine). Anyone wanna take a shot at these people?

Phelous- he's difficult to type. ExTP probably. Goofy, very self-deprecating, very snarky, but he has a lot of standards and absolutely despises lazy, mean spirited tropes in movies like A Serbian Film.

The Nostalgia Critic- ENTP. Big mouth, very creative and memorable characters he's made, hates details, despite having a jerky persona he's got tons of friends and allies with other youtubers 

The Nostalgia Chick- ESTJ. More competent and in control of her feelings than Critic, 

Obscurus Lupa- ExFP. Love her but I find her a bit hard to type. She's one of the nicer reviewers, very upbeat and even goofier than Phelous. 

Film Brain- much less harsh than Critic or Phelous but still a little scathing. Classy and a bit proper. ISxJ? (Not counting how Critic infantlized him in Kickassia.)

Sad Panda- IxTP. Soft boi, awkward, prefers working behind the scenes and doesn't get much screentime in videos, loves music. 

Cinema Snob- ENTJ? No patience at all, doesn't really focus on bad messages in movies so much as quality filmmaking (except in movies like ""Old-Fashioned"" that heavily promoted unhealthy romantic relationships).

Bobsheaux- ISxP. He's so chill, makes good points but doesn't goniut of his way to look clever, not very crude like a lot of reviewers, as long as you don't insult the audience's intelligence by making awful children's shows. (Raven is probably ISTP.)"
amberdragonfly11,ISFP,"I know there's differences between the two but I sometimes struggle to explain what they are or when I'm making playlists/aesthetics for them. What do you all think?

Cottagecore: 

-Clothing can be casual but often is frilly, lacy, Victorian, floral, girly, not stuff you would wear out working in the garden for example 

-More modern clothing, music, and appliances- see Studio Ghibli's general settings

-Soft colors, lots of white

-Hygge, minimalist usually 

-Often crosses over with fairycore or naturecore

Grandmacore:

-Overalls, rainboots, cardigans, sweaters, clothing that can be cute but is often more practical and comfy than stylish

-Old-fashioned by nature- record players, oldie music,  lack of smart phones or laptops or anything 

-Sometimes soft colors, often stuff like 70s earth tones or gray

- Cozy clutter (but not dirty) from knickknacks, photos, etc. Frugal living but not minimalist

-Often crosses over with midwestcore, farmcore, or countrycore 

I guess the tl;dr version is cottagecore = frilly, eclectic and hygge, grandmacore = cozy, vintage and earthy. Does that make sense?"

As long as you don't owe them, when they ask you for help, or even when you feel the need to help unasked, ask yourself these, 
* Will they appreciate your contribution like you expect them to? 
* Will they reciprocate for you? 
* Do they require your help because there is no else? 
* What are you sacrificing while helping them? 
* Is it worth your sacrifice? 

If the answer to even one of these is no, then turn that attention and care you were gonna give them onto yourself. And use that desire to develop yourself in someway. Take care of yourself.

If you can't find a reason to care for yourself, or you think you don't deserve it, then it's seriously time to rethink everything.

They sound like reasonable excuses, but I can't help but sense that something's not right. Why wouldn't he have responded or called her back after work? 

Can anyone possibly provide some insight into what's happening?

(Edit: Thank you all for being straightforward, everyone. I really appreciate your type in this way. Thank you!)

(Edit 2: She's insisting that he's just stressed. Well, we can hope, right?)"

elvenfangirl,ISFP,"Hello! ISFP writer here! I've got a male INTJ character that is trying to impress a girl and am wondering how you INTJ types flirt.

Not sure if this will help, but here's a little backstory...
He is an assassin working for an agency that wants to bring down the unjust and corrupt monarchies of the world (it's a dystopian world, so they're everywhere). The girl is a princess, the heir to a throne, actually, and she is rather naive. He is doing his best to reel her in and get her to trust him.

Any and all ideas are welcome! Thanks for reading!"
elvenfangirl,ISFP,Which type is the most empathetic? Does each type have a different kind of empathy?
elvenfangirl,ISFP,"Any of y'all eat ice?

I like having something to crunch on while drinking water. Is anyone else the same way?"
fre_ii1,ISFP,"A reasonable person would know this already, so im kinda making a reminder....
this subreddit really gave estps a bad rep for sure and ive constantly seen people stereotype them as jerks and bullies. like any other type, there's so much more to it and some i know turn mundane situation into a blast :) Chads can have depth and vulnerability too. When you ignore all the negative stereotypes or meet one irl without knowing they are an ESTP, its easier to see what i'm talking about. an estp made me blush today so i guess maybe thats why im sucking up to them so hard rn ;u; üíï"
mkmike000,ISTP,"Yoyo,

It's this thing, that gets criticized about me all the time! I tried learning about it more, talked about people here and there but ultimately I don't understand how people base their cognitive thinking in rational thought. It affects my behavior and validation from people which hurts, I don't want to be like them but what I want is to argue more on a rational basis. I'm scared to have an argument with people because I know they will destroy me and have the upper hand and therefore i'm prompt to go with their decisions. I hate to get myself in situations like this because of my problem.

Anyone experience or have experienced the same and found a solution for this?

Thanks for taking the time to read."
mkmike000,ISTP,"Hi, I wanted to go threw the list of my followings on Instagram and make an easily accessible order of information via dictionaries.

So far everything is fine, I get the list from Instagram, and appended them to my own separated lists.

My problem occurs when I want to loop threw my list and update the information of my dictionaries.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**My Output:** 

{0: {'user\_id': 'gameofthronesnotofficial', 'user\_name': 'Game of Thrones'}}

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

The output format is right but the iteration is only once, and i dont understand why its not looping threw all profiles?

I searched the web for a possible solution. I thought for myself what is wrong but can't come up with the solution. I really would appreciate it if someone could point out where my mistake is!

mkmike000,ISTP,"hi, i have a very artistic mind, which lead to mistakes on various tasks. there are many examples i could give where i messed up. but the core problem are not the failures but simple logical and rational thinking. it seems everybody is getting it(have a intuition/ sense), except me. all i want to do is make the task at hand coherent but people with more of a logical/ rational thinking pattern don‚Äòt really value this. 

So what are the right paths of possibilities i can take to improve my situation? maybe you can give me some terms i can lookup as well? 

thanks"
mkmike000,ISTP,i have the tendency to be the guy who only wants to know what other people know in conversations. but i like to hold more casual conversations that can hold a little bit without any knowledge of a certain topic.. more of a back and forth convo. you guys have any good tips?

mkmike000,ISTP,i tend to ask questions that are not going the main road of the objective. how do i improve to ask the myself the right questions based on a situation?
mkmike000,ISTP,"hi. 
i feel like i have some hate for high te users. maybe its hard for me to think about understanding them in the way they can understand me as well. but for anything te users criticize ti users very often about their thinking. 
need to know how you guys handle this? are there any principles or strategy i can use to understand their way of thinking better and connect more with it? i know their all about logic which i improved upon time and still a fuckup.. but honestly this is not always my thinking pattern. so maybe you have some tips here to how to think and improve about it? it would help me so much, because it is like the only thing people criticize me on. i hate it. one thing i learned: 1. being effective, then efficent. 

i guess there are simple rules that i was ignoring in my young age, so i have to learn them now. 
thanks in advance!!!"
mkmike000,ISTP,"On myself I have noticed that its really fucking hard to come up with imaginative(non-reality) scenarios. Not that I like it really, but more of a need for fulfillment. 

Currently i am searching for a corp/brand name which uses mainly my Ni. I notice i feel stuck because I lay down all day for very long period of time now thinkering and not coming up with many ideas. I come up with cool ones that I like, so it gets somewhat in the right direction.. but heavly and slowly like a turtle. I just want to come up with my element(for the turtle: water) and swim in ease.. you know?

Back to the topic. I've recently learned about the 'Shadow Functions', particually 'the blindspot'. For us ISTPs it is the Ne function and i can definitely resonate with that in many areas, which actually makes me sick of this fuck, like hell now.

It feels like, there has to be other people need to be involved in many areas, where I would value Independence but cant get it because of the lack of ideas to come up with myself.

As far what i've read and see in reality and pics to visualize it, is that: Ne's can have one thing they're little excited about and have 12 different thoughts on how thing could be poetic about/ modified in weird or different ways or something(IDK?!). It just seems they have so many ideas that they can't start to do one thing. 

i.e: they would know what they could do(like improvise) with a lamp or website or whatever without knowing anything of that shit. and i know everything and still just think of installing a fucking spoiler on it. i can build every abstract shit but coming up with something out of nothing seems to me inimagineable(if this is a word?).

I would really appreciate it, if someone could explain me this function so i can learn from it and practice it deeply. That means: please provide good understanding, details, examples and maybe experiances?

good night."
mkmike000,ISTP,"J am curious how you interpret/ know the difference between them two, because honestly I don't understand the difference clearly between them two. could someone explain in clear words and or examples, please? thanks."
mkmike000,ISTP,"The Q already tells it actually. In other words.., anything cool that could be shared for other ISTPs to know, to handle a hard task or a bad bias that could come up often for other ISTPs in general or something else that pops into your mind that could benefit our personality type? 
I am curious. Thanks."
Powerful_Memer,ENTP,"Let's hope that doesnt get my first post here removed LOL alright so I'm an ENTP I know you guys have been hearing a lot about us recently and I'm sorry to annoy you more with our type. Anyways,


Let me start off with I love Fi. Therefore ISFP's are just mmmmmmm. Though to give you some more insight on our personality, ""Fi is the worst function for an unhealthy ENTP"", and I can stand to that, IXFP's have continually shoved battering rams of grief up my ass, so it is an extreme love/hate relationship. 


But ok, I know that ISFP'S dont open up much, at least it takes a lot of time. I've seen this real time. My amazing ISFP friend has opened up to a few people (not me), people are patient and great friends, great people they are.


Now, I was in a short relationship with this person (and I dont have the chance to really date them again) but the problem is that I'm so fast to open up to people, especially ISFP's. This is a problem (a me problem, not a her problem), cause when they dont tell me things about themselves I get really nervous, and my Ne is like uh does she not like me does she like him who better suits her am I rushing am I doing well is she lying to me do they like me (and it makes several connections to how that could be the truth) and that reflects in my actions and then she stopped liking.


 Now a few months have passed and I feel like I've now gotten over the hiccup of stress while talking to the entire friend group, but specifically her. Talking with her... is just so easy. And she knows a lot about me, but I dont know much of her. Now you may think oh he's about to ask how do I get her to talk, but no, no I am not, because I know how. Be a good and patient friend. The problem is patience; I know I have more patience than before, but I dont think it is enough still, so how would I get the patience to let her open up slowly? (I now realize I should be asking the ENTP subcult for this, but you guys can help too maybe). I really should delete all of this but whatever."
Powerful_Memer,ENTP,Enlighten me with your reasons
Powerful_Memer,ENTP,"Had an argument with my mom, every time i yelled i would say sorry a second later

Ranting feels even worse, cause im not angry in the moment so it is like even more uncomfortable (i suspect this for entps, no ranting flair)

Yelling does feel good, but I'll usually say sorry after my immediate anger gets out

Crying feels amazing, but i physically cannot

Abd when i did,  i was like no that's bullshit shut up Aidan, cause it is

Basically emotions trapped :)

I feel ur pain guys üòî we'll get through it together"

Powerful_Memer,ENTP,"So, I would like to see if theres some correlation with addictive personalities and mbti. Addictive personalities means you get addicted extremely easily to things. No need for life stories (unless you feel like it, in which I will gladly listen), just tell me your personality type, and yes or no. Quick and easy. I really really hope I can get some answers here. For reference, I have the most addictive personality I know ever. Do other ENTP's relate to that?"

Powerful_Memer,ENTP,"So I was discussing with a friend about our preferences in a girl, and I said that I'm not attracted to 75% of black women because of their large noses and their coarse hair, and my friend agreed. Then people in my discord server are calling me racist. I tried to explain that because of their facial features I didnt find them attractive, but they wouldnt budge (the three who complained are all not black). 1, 2, 3, and 4 including myself were all saying that it isnt because they have an african ethnic background, and I thought they were crazy because these of these two messages:

 ""(Me):So because I am not sexually attracted to most african americans, that makes me racist?""

(Them):""Yes"".  

And this stook out to me: ""you said you don‚Äôt find, curly(they said curly instead of coarse) hair, wide noses. Look at any art from Africa, and you‚Äôll see the same thing, most african, dark skin, I mean, have those features, most of them, I never said they were a clone. Just like you could say most Americans have narrow noses, and wider eyes. You said you found that unattractive. I‚Äôm not generalizing, it‚Äôs a fact. Women that are darkskinned, go through this everyday, it‚Äôs colorist at the very least. And when you pulled up black women you found attractive, they were light skinned(wrong, got one lightskinned another darkskinned) get help soon""

Now obviously, I dont want to be a racist, I take deep deep offense to that. And I thought that E V E R Y B O D Y  had a sexual preference. Theres no way, right?

Edit, the sequel: ok maybe I shouldnt put my discord tag that was a bad idea, dm me if u arent crazy tho, we can be friends."
Powerful_Memer,ENTP,"Hi so basically I'm a 13 year old entering high school and I decided to start working out with my older  brother and his friends (all 17 and 18). He has two friends that have both been doing track and field for 4 years so they're way out of league it was surprisingly generous they even offered to let us join them. One of them is 6 feet 130-140 pounds and can sprint an 11.5 second 100m. The second is 5 foot 9 140-150 and can sprint a 13.5 second sprint I'm pretty sure (I dont think he's a sprinter). Lastly my older brother is 145 pounds 5 foot 9 inexperienced and his lowest was a 16-16 and a half.   Now we get into me, 5 foot 10 175 pound mildly asthmatic who couldnt get sub 20 until recently where I got a 17 (which is definitely still not in the realm of good). My endurance is by far the biggest problem on the track, so I turn to these dashes where asthma and endurance dont impact me. I dont have spiked shoes just cheap running shoes, and as we can see from the 3 second subtraction I am indeed improving but my goal is to become a decent and respectable sprinter above anything. So, what are some simple things I can do for improvement?"
